      "text/plain": "'FOREWORD \\n\\n\\nDawn was breaking as the big Hog scooted through the streets. My five \\nwhores were chattering like drunk magpies. I smelled the stink that only a \\nstreet whore has after a long, busy night. The inside of my nose was raw. It \\nhappens when you’re a pig for snorting cocaine. \\n\\nMy nose was on fire and the stink of those whores and the gangster they \\nwere smoking seemed like invisible knives scraping to the root of my brain. I \\nwas in an evil, dangerous mood despite that pile of scratch crammed into the \\nglove compartment. \\n\\n“Goddamnit, has one of you bitches shit on herself or something?” I \\nbellowed as I flipped the long window toward me. For a long moment there \\nwas silence. \\n\\nThen Rachel, my bottom whore, cracked in a pleasing ass-kissing voice. \\n“Daddy Baby, that ain’t no shit you smell. We been turning all night and ain’t \\nno bathrooms in those tricks’ cars we been flipping out of. Daddy, we sure \\nbeen humping for you, and what you smell is our nasty whore asses.” \\n\\nI grinned widely, inside of course. The best pimps keep a steel lid on their \\nemotions and I was one of the iciest. The whores went into fits of giggles at \\nRachel’s shaky witticism. A pimp is happy when his whores giggle. He \\nknows they are still asleep. \\n\\nI coasted the Hog into the curb outside the hotel where Kim, my newest, \\nprettiest girl, was cribbing. Jesus! I would be glad to drop the last whore off \\nso I could get to my own hotel to nurse my nose with cocaine and be alone. \\nAny good pimp is his own best company. His inner life is so rich with \\ncunning and scheming to out-think his whores. \\n\\nAs Kim got out I said, “Goodnight Baby, today is Saturday so I want \\neverybody in the street at noon instead of seven tonight. I said noon, not five \\nminutes after or two minutes after, but at twelve noon sharp I want you down, \\ngot it. Baby?” \\n\\nShe didn’t answer, but she did a strange thing. She walked into the street \\naround the Hog to the window on my side. She stood looking at me for a long \\n\\n\\n\\nmoment, her beautiful face tense in the dim dawn. \\n\\nThen in her crisp New England accent she said, “Are you coming back to \\nmy pad this morning? You haven’t spent a night with me in a month. So \\ncome back, okay?” \\n\\nA good pimp doesn’t get paid for screwing, he gets his pay off for always \\nhaving the right thing to say to a whore right on lightning tap. I knew my four \\nwhores were flapping their ears to get my reaction to this beautiful bitch. A \\npimp with an overly fine bitch in his stable has to keep his game tight. \\nWhores constantly probe for weakness in a pimp. \\n\\nI fitted a scary mask on my face and said, in a low deadly voice, “Bitch, \\nare you insane? No bitch in this family calls any shots or muscles me to do \\nanything. Now take your stinking yellow ass upstairs to a bath and some shut \\neye, and get in the street at noon like I told you.” \\n\\nThe bitch just stood there, her eyes slitted in anger. I could sense she was \\ngame to play the string out right there in the street before my whores. If I had \\nbeen ten years dumber I would have leaned out of that Hog and broken her \\njaw, and put my foot in her ass, but the joint was too fresh in my mind. \\n\\nI knew the bitch was trying to booby trap me when she spat out her \\ninvitation. “Come on kick my ass. What the hell do I need with a man I only \\nsee when he comes to get his money? I am sick of it all. I don’t dig stables \\nand never will. I know I’m the new bitch who has to prove herself. Well \\nGoddamnit, I am sick of this shit. I’m cutting out.” \\n\\nShe stopped for air and lit a cigarette. I was going to blast her ass off when \\nshe finished. So, I just sat there staring at her. \\n\\nThen she went on, “I have turned more tricks in the three months I have \\nbeen with you than in the whole two years with Paul. My pussy stays sore \\nand swollen. Do I get my ass kicked before I split? If so, kick it now because \\nI am going back to Providence on the next thing smoking.” \\n\\nShe was young, fast with trick appeal galore. She was a pimp’s dream and \\nshe knew it. She had tested me with her beef and now she was lying back for \\na sucker response. \\n\\nI disappointed her with my cold overlay. I could see her wilt as I said in an \\nicy voice. “Listen square-ass Bitch, I have never had a whore I couldn’t do \\nwithout. I celebrate, Bitch, when a whore leaves me. It gives some worthy \\nbitch a chance to take her place and be a star. You scurvy Bitch, if I shit in \\nyour face, you gotta love it and open your mouth wide.” \\n\\nThe rollers cruised by in a squad car so I flashed a sucker smile on my face \\n\\n\\n\\nand cooled it until they passed. Kim was rooted there wincing under the \\nblizzard. \\n\\nI went on ruthlessly, “Bitch, you are nothing but a funky zero. Before me \\nyou had one chili chump with no rep. Nobody except his mother ever heard \\nof the bastard. Yes Bitch, I’ll be back this morning to put your phony ass on \\nthe train.” \\n\\nI rocketed away from the curb. In the rear-view mirror I saw Kim walk \\nslowly into the hotel, her shoulders slumped. In the Hog, until I dropped the \\nlast whore off you could have heard a mosquito crapping on the moon. I had \\ntested out for them, “solid ice.” \\n\\nI went back for Kim. She was packed and silent. On the way to the station, \\nI riffled the pages in that pimp’s book in my head for an angle to hold her \\nwithout kissing her ass. \\n\\nI couldn’t find a line in it for an out like that. As it turned out the bitch was \\ntesting and bluffing right down the line. \\n\\nWe had pulled into the station parking lot when the bitch fell to pieces. Her \\neyes were misty when she yelped, “Daddy, are you really going to let me \\nsplit? Daddy, I love you!” \\n\\nI started the prat action to cinch her when I said, “Bitch, I don’t want a \\nwhore with rabbit in her. I want a bitch who wants me for life. You have got \\nto go after that bullshit earlier this morning, you are not that bitch.” \\n\\nThat prat butchered her and she collapsed into my lap crying and begging \\nto stay. I had a theory about splitting whores. I think they seldom split \\nwithout a bankroll. \\n\\nSo, I cracked on her, “Give me that scratch you held out and maybe I will \\ngive you another chance.” \\n\\nSure enough she reached into her bosom and drew out close to five bills \\nand handed it to me. No pimp with a brain in his head cuts loose a young \\nbeautiful whore with lots of mileage left in her. I let her come back. \\n\\nWhen at long last I was driving toward my hotel I remembered what Baby \\nJones, the master pimp who turned me out, had said about whores like Kim. \\n\\n“Slim,” he had said, “A pretty Nigger bitch and a white whore are just \\nalike. They both will get in a stable to wreck it and leave the pimp on his ass \\nwith no whore. You gotta make ’em hump hard and fast to stick ’em for long \\nscratch quick. Slim, pimping ain’t no game of love, so prat ’em and keep \\nyour swipe outta ’em. Any sucker who believe a whore loves him shouldn’t a \\nfell outta his mammy’s ass.” \\n\\n\\n\\nMy mind went back to Pepper. Then back even further and I remembered \\nwhat he had said about The Georgia. \\n\\n“Slim, a pimp is really a whore who has reversed the game on whores. So \\nSlim, be as sweet as the scratch, no sweeter, and always stick a whore for a \\nbundle before you sex her. A whore ain’t nothing but a trick to a pimp. Don’t \\nlet ’em Georgia you. Always get your money in front just like a whore. \\n\\nOn the elevator riding to my pad I thought about the first bitch who had \\nGeorgied me and how she had flim-flammed me out of my head. She would \\nbe old and gray now, but if I could find her I would sure get the bitch’s \\nunpaid account off my conscience. \\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE \\n\\n\\nIn this book I will take you, the reader, with me into the secret inner world of \\nthe pimp. I will lay bare my life and thoughts as a pimp. The account of my \\nbrutality and cunning as a pimp will fill many of you with revulsion, \\nhowever, if one intelligent, valuable young man or woman can be saved from \\nthe destructive slime; then the displeasure I have given will have been \\noutweighed by that individual’s use of his potential in a socially constructive \\nmanner. \\n\\nI regret that it is impossible to recount to you all of my experiences as a \\npimp. Unfortunately, it would require the combined pages of a half-dozen \\nbooks. Perhaps my remorse for my ghastly life will diminish to the degree \\nthat within this one book I have been allowed to purge myself. Perhaps one \\nday I can win respect as a constructive human being. Most of all I wish to \\nbecome a decent example for my children and for that wonderful woman in \\nthe grave, my mother. \\n\\n\\n\\n1 \\n\\nTORN FROM THE NEST \\n\\n\\nHer name was Maude and she Georgied me around 1921. I was only three \\nyears old. Mama told me about it, and always when she did her rage and \\nindignation would be as strong and as emotional perhaps as at the time when \\nshe had surprised her, panting and moaning at the point of orgasm with my \\ntiny head wedged between her ebony thighs, her massive hands viselike \\naround my head. \\n\\nMama worked long hours in a hand laundry and Maude had been hired as a \\nbabysitter at fifty cents a day. Maude was a young widow. Strangely, she had \\na reputation in Indianapolis, Indiana as a devout Holy Roller. \\n\\nI have tried through the years to remember her face but all I can remember \\nis the funky ritual. I vaguely remember, not her words but her excitement \\nwhen we were alone. \\n\\nI remember more vividly the moist, odorous darkness and the bristle-like \\nhairs tickling my face and most vividly I can remember my panic, when in \\nthe wild moment of her climax, she would savagely jerk my head even tighter \\ninto the hairy maw. \\n\\nI couldn’t get a breath of air until like a huge black balloon she would \\nexhale with a whistling whoosh and relax, limply freeing my head. \\n\\nI remember the ache of the strain on my fragile neck muscles, and \\nespecially at the root of my tongue. \\n\\nMama and I had come to Indianapolis from Chicago, where since the time \\nwhen she was six months pregnant, my father had begun to show his true \\ncolors as an irresponsible, white-spats-wearing bum. \\n\\nBack in that small town in Tennessee, their home town, he had stalked the \\nbeautiful virgin and conned her into marriage. Her parents, with vast relief, \\ngave their blessing and wished them the best in the promised land up North in \\n\\n\\n\\nChicago. \\n\\nMama had ten brothers and sisters. Her marriage meant one less mouth to \\nfeed. \\n\\nMy father’s father was a skilled cook and he passed his know how to my \\nfather, who shortly after getting to Chicago scored a chef’s job at a huge \\nmiddle-class hotel. Mama was put on as a waitress. \\n\\nMama told me that even with both of them working twelve hours a day, six \\ndays a week they couldn’t save a nickel or buy furniture or anything. \\n\\nMy idiot father had come to the big city and gone sucker wild. He couldn’t \\nstay away from the high-yellow whores with their big asses and bitch-dog \\nsexual antics. What they didn’t con him out of he lost in the cheat crap joints. \\n\\nAt the hotel one night he vanished from the kitchen. Mama finally found \\nhim thrusting mightily into a half-white waitress lying on a sack of potatoes \\nin a storage room, with her legs locked around his back. \\n\\nMama said she threw everything she could lift at them. They were \\nunemployed when they walked away from the shambles. \\n\\nMy father tearfully vowed to straighten himself out and be a man, but he \\ndidn’t have the will, the strength to resist the cheap thrills of the city. \\n\\nAfter my birth he got worse and had the stupid gall to suggest to Mama \\nthat I be put on a Catholic Church doorstep. Mama naturally refused so he \\nhurled me against the wall in disgust. \\n\\nI survived it and he left us, his white spats flashing and his derby hat at a \\nrakish angle. \\n\\nIt was the beginning of a bitter winter. Mama packed pressing irons and \\nwaving combs into a small bag and wrapped me warmly in blankets and set \\nout into the bleak, friendless city to ring door bells, the bag in one arm and I \\nin the other. \\n\\nHer pitch was something like this, “Madam, I can make your hair curly and \\nbeautiful. Please give me a chance. For fifty cents, that’s all, I will make your \\nhair shine like new money.” \\n\\nAt this point in the pitch Mama told me she would slip the blanket aside to \\nbare my wee big-eyed face. The sight of me in her arm on a subzero day was \\nlike a charm. She managed to make a living for us. \\n\\nThat spring, with new friends of Mama’s we left Chicago for Indianapolis. \\nWe stayed there until nineteen twenty-four, when a fire gutted the hand \\nlaundry where Mama worked. \\n\\nThere were no jobs in Indianapolis for Mama and for six months we barely \\n\\n\\n\\nmade it on the meager savings. We were penniless and with hardly any food \\nwhen a tall black angel visiting relatives in Indianapolis came into our lives. \\n\\nHe fell instantly in love with my lissome beautiful mother. His name was \\nHenry Upshaw, and I guess I fell as hard for him as he fell for Mama. \\n\\nHe took us back to Rockford, Illinois with him where he owned a cleaning \\nand pressing shop, the only Negro business in downtown Rockford. \\n\\nIn those tough depression times a Negro in his position was the envy of \\nmost Negro men. \\n\\nHenry was religious, ambitious, good and kind. I often wonder what would \\nhave happened to my life if I had not been torn from him. \\n\\nHe treated Mama like she was a princess, anything she wanted he got for \\nher. She was a fashion plate all right. \\n\\nEvery Sunday when we all three went to church in the gleaming black \\nDodge we were an outstanding sight as we walked down the aisle in our fresh \\nneat clothing. \\n\\nOnly the few Negro lawyers and physicians lived as well, looked as well. \\nMama was president of several civic clubs. For the first time we were living \\nthe good life. \\n\\nMama had a dream. She told it to Henry. Like the genie of the lamp he \\nmade it a reality. \\n\\nIt was a four stall, opulent beauty shop. Its chrome gleamed in the black- \\nand-gold motif. It was located in the heart of the Negro business section and \\nit flourished from the moment its doors opened. \\n\\nHer clientele was for the most part whores, pimps, and hustlers from the \\nsprawling red light district in Rockford. They were the only ones who always \\nhad the money to spend on their appearance. \\n\\nThe first time I saw Steve he was sitting getting his nails manicured in the \\nshop. Mama was smiling into his handsome olive-tinted face as she buffed \\nhis nails. \\n\\nI didn’t know when I first saw him that he was the pin-striped snake who \\nwould poison the core of our lives. \\n\\nI certainly had no inkling that last day at the shop as live billows of steam \\nhissed from the old pressing machine each time Henry slammed its lid down \\non a garment. \\n\\nJesus! It was hot in that little shop, but I loved every minute of it. It was \\nschool-vacation time for me and every summer I worked in the shop all day, \\nevery day helping my stepfather. \\n\\n\\n\\nThat day as I saw my reflection on the banker’s expensive black shoes, I \\nwas perhaps the happiest black boy in Rockford. As I applied the sole \\ndressing I hummed my favorite tune “Spring Time in the Rockies.” \\n\\nThe banker stepped down from the shine stand, stood for a moment as I \\nflicked lint from his soft, rich suit, then with a warm smile he pressed an \\nextravagant fifty-cent piece into my hand and stepped out into the broiling \\nstreet. \\n\\nNow I whistled my favorite tune, shines were only a dime, what a tip. \\n\\nI didn’t know at the time that the banker would never press another coin \\ninto my hand, that for the next thirty-five years this last day would be \\nremembered vividly as the final day of real happiness for me. \\n\\nI would press five-dollar bills into the palms of shine boys. My shoes \\nwould be handmade, would cost three times as much as the banker’s shoes, \\nbut my shoes, though perfectly fitted would be worn in tension and fear. \\n\\nThere was really nothing out of the ordinary that day. Nothing during that \\nday that I heard or saw that prepared me for the swift, confusing events that \\nover the weekend would slam my life away from all that was good to all that \\nwas bad. \\n\\nNow, looking back remembering that last day in the shop as clearly as if it \\nwere yesterday, my stepfather, Henry, was unusually quiet. My young mind \\ncouldn’t grasp his worry, his heart break. \\n\\nEven I, a ten year old, knew that this huge, ugly, black man who had \\nrescued Mama and me from actual starvation back in Indianapolis loved us \\nwith all of his great, sensitive heart. \\n\\nI loved Henry with all my heart. He was the only father I had ever really \\nknown. \\n\\nHe could have saved himself an early death from a broken heart if instead \\nof falling so madly in love with Mama he had run as fast as he could away \\nfrom her. For him, she was brown-skin murder in a size-twelve dress. \\n\\nThat last night at eight o’clock Dad and I flicked the shop’s lights out as \\nalways at closing. \\n\\nIn an emotion muffled voice he spoke my name “Bobby.” \\n\\nI turned toward him and looked up into his face tense and strained in the \\npale light from the street lamp. I was confused and shaken when he put his \\nmassive hands on my shoulders and drew me to him very tightly just holding \\nme in this strange desperate way. \\n\\nMy head was pressed against his belt buckle. I could barely hear his low, \\n\\n\\n\\nrapid flow of pitiful words. \\n\\nHe said, “Bobby, you know I love you and Mama, don’t you?” \\n\\nHis stomach muscles were cording, jerking against my cheek. I knew he \\nwas going to burst into tears. \\n\\nI said as I squeezed my arms around his waist, “Yes, Daddy, yes. Daddy. \\nWe love you too, Daddy. We always will, Daddy.” \\n\\nHe was trembling as he said, “You and Mama wouldn’t ever leave me? \\nYou know Bobby, I ain’t got nobody in the world but you two. I just couldn’t \\ngo on if you left me alone.” \\n\\nI clung tightly to him and said, “Don’t worry Daddy, we’ll never leave \\nyou, I promise, honest. Daddy.” \\n\\nWhat a sight we must have been, the six-foot-six black giant and the frail \\nlittle boy holding on to each other for dear life, crying there in the darkness. \\n\\nI tell you when we finally made it to the big black Dodge and were riding \\nhome my thoughts were turning madly. \\n\\nYes, poor Henry’s fears had foundation. Mama had never loved my \\nstepfather. This kind, wonderful man had only been a tool of convenience. \\nShe had fallen in love with the snake all right. \\n\\nHis plan was to cop Mama and make it to the Windy. The dirty bastard \\nknew I would be excess baggage, but the way Mama was gulping his con, he \\nfigured he could get rid of me later. \\n\\nOnly after I had become a pimp years later would I know Steve’s complete \\nplot, and how stupid he really was. \\n\\nHere this fool had a smart, square broad with a progressive square-john \\nhusband, infatuated with him. Her business was getting better all the time. \\n\\nHer sucker husband was blindly in love, and the money from his business \\nwas wide open to her. If Steve had been clever he could have stayed right \\nthere on top of things and bled a big bankroll from the businesses in a couple \\nof years. \\n\\nThen he could have pulled Mama out of there and with a big bankroll he \\ncould have done anything with her, even turned her out. \\n\\nI tell you she was that hot for him. She had to be insane over the asshole to \\nwalk away from all that potential with only twenty-five hundred in cash. \\n\\nSteve blew it in a Georgia-skin game within a week after we got to \\nChicago. \\n\\nI have wished to Christ, in four penitentiaries, that the lunatic lovers had \\nleft me in Rockford with Henry when they split. \\n\\n\\n\\nOne scene in my life I can never forget and that was that morning when \\nMama had finished packing our clothes and Henry lost his inner fight for his \\npride and dignity. \\n\\nHe fell down on his knees and bawled like a scalded child, pleading with \\nMama not to leave him, begging her to stay. He had welded his arms around \\nher legs, his voice hoarse in anguish, as he whimpered his love for us. \\n\\nHis agonized eyes walled up at her as he wailed, “Please don’t leave me. \\nYou are sure to kill me if you do. I ain’t done nothing. If I have, forgive me.” \\n\\nI will never forget her face, as cold as an executioner’s, which she was, as \\nshe kicked and struggled loose from him. \\n\\nThen with an awful grin on her face she lied and said, “Henry, Honey, I \\njust want to get away for a while. Darling, we’ll be back.” \\n\\nIn his state she was lucky he hadn’t killed her and me, and buried us in the \\nbackyard. \\n\\nAs the cab drove us away to the secret rendezvous with Steve sitting in his \\nold Model T, I looked back at Henry on the porch, his chest heaving as tears \\nrolled down his tortured face. \\n\\nThere were too many wheels within wheels, too much hurt for me to cry. \\nAfter a blank time and distance we got to Chicago. Steve had vanished and \\nMama was telling me in a drab hotel room that my real father was coming \\nover to see us, and to remember that Steve was her cousin. \\n\\nSteve was stupid all right, but cunning, if you get what I mean. \\n\\nMama, at Steve’s instruction, weeks before, had gotten in contact with my \\nfather through a hustler brother of Mama’s in Chicago. \\n\\nWhen my father came through the hotel room door reeking of cologne and \\ndressed to kill, all I could think was what Mama had told me about that \\nmorning when this tall brown-skin joker had tossed me against the wall. \\n\\nHe took a long look at me. It was like looking in a mirror. His deep down \\nguilt cream puffed him and he grabbed me and squeezed me to him. I was \\nstiff and tense in the stranger’s arms, but I had looked in the mirror too when \\nhe came in, so I strung my arms limply about his neck. \\n\\nWhen he hugged Mama, her face was toward me and stony, like back there \\nwith Henry. My father strutted about that hotel room boasting of his personal \\nchef’s job for Big Bill Thompson the mayor of Chicago. \\n\\nHe told Mama and me, “I am a changed man now. I have saved my money \\nand now I really have something to offer my wife and son. Won’t you come \\nback to me and try again? I am older now, and I bitterly regret my mistakes \\n\\n\\n\\nof the past.” \\n\\nLike a black-widow spider spinning a web around her prey. Mama put up \\nenough resistance to make him pitch himself into a sweat then agreed to go \\nback to him. \\n\\nMy father’s house was crammed with expensive furniture and art pieces. \\nHe had thousands of dollars invested in rich clothing and linens. \\n\\nAfter a week, my hustler uncle brought Steve to visit us, and to case the lay \\nout. My father bought the cousin angle and broke out his best cigars and \\ncognac for the thieves. It was another week before they took him off. \\n\\nRemember, at the time I had no idea as to what really was going to happen. \\nI would learn the shocking truth only after we got to Milwaukee. \\n\\nOn that early evening when it happened Mama was jittery as we prepared \\nto visit some close white friends of my father. I had a wonderful time getting \\nacquainted with the host’s children who were around my age. Too soon it \\nwas time to go home. \\n\\nIn my lifetime I have seen many degrees of shock and surprise on the \\nhuman face. I have never seen on any face the traumatic disbelief and shock \\nthat was on my father’s face when he unlocked the door and stepped into his \\ncompletely empty house. His lips flapped mutely. He couldn’t speak. \\nEverything was gone, all the furniture and drapery, everything, from the \\npercolator to the pictures on the wall, even my Mama’s belongings. \\n\\nMama stood there in the empty house clinging to him, comforting him, \\nsobbing with real tears flowing down her cheeks. I guess she was crying in \\njoy because the cross had come off so beautifully. \\n\\nMama missed her calling. She should have been a film actress. With only a \\nbit part, an Oscar a season would have been a lead-pipe cinch for her. \\n\\nMama told my father we would go to Indianapolis to friends until he could \\nput another nest together. \\n\\nWhen we got to Milwaukee by train, ninety miles away, Steve had rented a \\nhouse. Every square inch of that house was filled with my father’s things. \\n\\nThose lovely things did us little good and brought no happiness. Steve, \\nwith his mania for craps, within weeks had sold everything, piece by piece, \\nand lost it across the craps table. \\n\\nMama worked long hours as a cook, and Steve and I were alone quite \\noften. \\n\\nAt these times he would say, “You little mother-fucker, you. I’m going to \\nbeat your mother-fucking ass. I am telling you, if you don’t run away. I’m \\n\\n\\n\\ngoing to kill you.” \\n\\nHe was just so cruel to me. My mother had bought me a little baby cat. I \\nloved that kitten, and this man hated animals. One day the cat, being a baby \\ncat, did his business on the kitchen floor. \\n\\nSteve said, “Where is that little mother-fucker?” \\n\\nThe little kitten had hidden under the sofa. He grabbed that kitten and took \\nit downstairs where there was a concrete wall. He grabbed it by the heels. I \\nwas standing (we lived on the second floor) looking down at him; he took the \\nkitten and beat its brains out against that wall. \\n\\nI remember, there was a park behind our house, concrete covered. There \\nwere some concrete steps. I sat there and I cried until I puked. All the while I \\nkept saying like a litany, “I hate Mama! I hate Mama! I hate Mama!” And, “I \\nhate Steve! I hate Steve! I hate him! I hate him!” \\n\\nFor many tortured years she would suffer her guilt. She had made that \\nterrible decision on that long ago weekend. \\n\\nI know my lousy old man deserved what happened to his goods. I know \\nMama got her revenge and it was sweet I am sure, but it was bitter for a kid \\nlike me to know that Mama was part of it. \\n\\nPerhaps if Mama had kept that burglary cross a secret from me, in some \\ntiny way I might have been stronger to fight off that pimping disease. I don’t \\nknow, but somehow after that cross Mama just didn’t seem like the same \\nhonest sweet Mama that I had prayed in church with back in Rockford. \\n\\nI went to her grave the other day and told her for the hundredth time since \\nher death, “Mama, it wasn’t really your fault. You were a dumb country girl, \\nyou didn’t understand. I was your first and only child. You couldn’t have \\nknown how important Henry was to me.” \\n\\nI choked up, stopped talking to her beneath the silent sod, and thought \\nabout Henry lying rotten, forgotten in his grave. \\n\\nThen, through my tight throat I said to Mama, “To you he was ugly, but \\nMama I swear to heaven he was so beautiful to me. I loved him Mama, I \\nneeded him. I wish you could have seen beyond his ugly black face and loved \\nhim a little and stayed with him. Mama, we could have been happy, our lives \\nwould have been different, but I don’t blame you. Mama, I love you.” \\n\\nI paused looking up at the sky, hoped she was up there and could hear me, \\nthen I went on, “I just wish you were alive now, you would be so proud of \\nme. I am not a lawyer as you always wanted me to be, but Mama, you have \\ntwo beautiful grandchildren and another on the way, and a fine daughter-in- \\n\\n\\n\\nlaw who looks a lot like you when you were young.” \\n\\nThe grave next to hers had visitors, an old man and a bright eyed girl about \\nten. \\n\\nI stopped my bragging until the pair walked away, then I said, “Mama, I \\nhaven’t shot any H in ten years. I haven’t had a whore in five years. I have \\nsquared up, I work every day. How about it Mama, Iceberg Slim a square? \\nYou wouldn’t believe it Mama, I wear fiftydollar suits right off the rack, and \\nmy car is ten years old, you gotta believe it now Mama. Goodbye Mama, see \\nyou at Christmas, and remember. I’ll always love you.” \\n\\nWhen I walked away from her grave I thought, “I don’t know, maybe that \\nprison head-shrinker was right when he told me I had become a pimp because \\nof my unconscious hatred for my mother.” \\n\\nI know one damn thing, I can’t help crying at her grave almost as if I was \\ncrying because I did so much to put her there. Maybe the hidden hate that I \\ncan’t feel wants me to laugh that she’s down there in the earth. Maybe my \\ncrying is really laughing. \\n\\nAbout ninety days after Steve smashed my kitten Mama cast off her spell, \\nand one gray April dawn while Steve lay in a drunken, open-mouthed stupor. \\nMama and I packed what we could carry and moved into a hotel room. It was \\ncomplete with hot plate and downthe-hall toilet. \\n\\nSteve had stomped on three and a half years of our lives. I would soon be \\nfourteen. \\n\\nOn August fourth, my birthday, our old friend Steve, with diabolical \\ntiming, made that event unforgettable. Since that chilly dawn in April he had \\nsearched the slum streets for his escaped dupes, thirsty for revenge. \\n\\nI waited eagerly in the hotel room for Mama who had promised to bake a \\ncake in her white woman’s kitchen. She said she would be home early at six \\no’clock to celebrate my birthday. \\n\\nWell, she came home all right on the seventh of August, from a hospital, \\nwith her broken jaw wired, and her body covered with bruises. \\n\\nSteve had stalked her and attacked her with his fists and feet and then \\nescaped through the grimy catacombs of the Ghetto. \\n\\nAll that night and all the next day I crouched in the dark shadows beneath \\nhis stairwell gripping a gleaming ice pick. He never came back. He had \\nmoved. \\n\\nTwenty years later, while idly looking from the window of a plush hotel \\nsuite I would see something familiar in the white-haired stooped figure of a \\n\\n\\n\\ngarbage collector on the street three stories down. \\n\\nI blacked out, when reason returned I was down there on the street in the \\nbright morning sunlight, clutching a pistol, wearing only a pair of red silk \\npajamas. \\n\\nAs the garbage truck turned the corner a block away out of range, a small \\ncrowd of passersby stood bug-eyed watching the strange scene as Rachel, my \\nmain whore, tugged at my arm, pleaded with me to get off the street. \\n\\nThat was the last time I saw Steve, but I just don’t know, even now, what I \\nwould do if our paths crossed. \\n\\nPerhaps that beating Mama took was good, as painful as it was. I \\nremember how it worried me in that cruddy hotel room when the hotel’s neon \\nsign outside our window would flash on her face. Her eyes would be bright, \\nriveted on the ceiling, she would be in a trance, remembering, still hot for \\nhim. \\n\\nAs worthless as that bastard was otherwise, he sure must have been a son- \\nof-a-bitch in the bed. \\n\\nAfter all he had done to us, she still had a terrible itch for the bastard. That \\nbeating was good for her, it cured the itch. \\n\\nMama had learned a bitter lesson the hard way. The country girl had rolled \\nin the hay with the city slicker and now I saw all of her sorrow and guilt in \\nher eyes. \\n\\nWe couldn’t go back to the peaceful, green hills of Rockford. She had \\ndestroyed a good man back there, a native son. Henry died a year after we left \\nhim. Until the grave claimed her, Henry would rise from his own to haunt her \\nin the lonely gloom. \\n\\nMama was desperate to save at least fragments of her image, to hold fast \\nthe love and respect I had for her in Rockford. I had seen too much, had \\nsuffered too much. The jungle had started to embalm me with bitterness and \\nhardness. \\n\\nI was losing, page by page, the fine rules of thought and deed that I had \\nlearned in church, from Henry to the Boy Scout Troop in Rockford. I was \\nsopping up the poison of the street like a sponge. \\n\\nI had begun to play Steve’s favorite game, craps, in the alleys after school. \\n\\nDangerously, I was frantic to sock it into every young girl weak enough to \\ngo for it. I had to run for my life one evening when an enraged father caught \\nme on his back porch punching animal-like astraddle his daughter’s head. I \\nhad become impatient with the unusual thickness of her maidenhead. \\n\\n\\n\\n2 \\n\\nFIRST STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE \\n\\n\\nThe slide was greased. I was starting my long plunge to the very bottom of \\nthe grim pit. I guess my trip downward really was cinched when I met a petty \\nhustler who was very likeable and we became pals. \\n\\nMy hustler pal was called Party Time. By the time he was twentythree he \\nhad done four bits in the joint. On each fall he had been jacked up for either \\nstrong-arm robbery or till tapping. \\n\\nHe got his moniker hung on him because as soon as he scored for scratch \\nhe would make fast tracks to the nearest underworld bar. \\n\\nWhen he got inside the door he would shout, “All right you poor ass \\nbastards, it’s party time and Joe Evans is in port with enough scratch to burn \\nup a wet elephant. All you studs stop playing stink finger with these long- \\ncock whores and everybody belly up to the log and get twisted on me.” \\n\\nHis flat African features were pasted to a skull that could have belonged to \\na cave man. He was short, powerful, and shiny black. \\n\\nHe was ugly enough to “break daylight with his fist,” but for some curious \\nreason he was irresistible to many of the thrill-seeking white women who \\nsneaked into the black side of town panting as they chased after that hoary \\nmyth, “Nigger men do it so good it thrills you to your toe nails.” \\n\\nThere was a Fast sheet joint with the trick rooms in the rear, right on the \\nalley. I was peeping one night into one through a frayed shade when I saw \\nParty Time for the first time. \\n\\nMy eyes were bugging when I saw the tall viking type white man, his tiny, \\nbut voluptuous female white companion and Party Time taking their clothes \\noff. Finally they stood there naked. I could see their lips moving so I pressed \\nmy ear and eye sideways against the window that was open a couple of \\ninches at the top to get the sound. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe white joker was tenderly hefting Party Time’s weapon in his hand like \\nmaybe it was Ming Dynasty Pottery. He said excitedly to the broad, “Oh! \\nHoney, can you believe the size, the beauty of it!” \\n\\nIn the glow of the room’s red light, that broad looked like an animated \\nportrait by Da Vinci. Her eyes were blue fire in her passion. She purred like a \\nPersian kitten and pounced onto the bed. \\n\\nParty Time stood at the side of the bed looking down at her. He was an \\nebony executioner. His horizontal axe cast a cruel shadow across the snowy \\npeaks, rose tipped. \\n\\nMy trouser front was tented as I pressed even tighter against the window. I \\nhad never seen anything like this back in Rockford. Then to my amazed ears, \\nthe white man said a strange thing as he pulled a chair to the end of the bed \\nand sat on the very edge of it. \\n\\nHe was breathing hard when he said, “All right now Boy, stab it into her, \\nhurt her, punish her, crucify her, good Boy! Good Boy!” \\n\\nThe broad looked so fragile and helpless to my naive eyes that I felt a pang \\nof pity pulse inside me as she moaned and whimpered in painful pleasure \\nbeneath the black demon savagely pile driving between the jerking white legs \\njack-knifed, imprisoned behind the sweating, hunching black shoulders. \\n\\nLike he was trying to make a home Party Time was asking in a hoarse \\nvoice over and over, “Beautiful Bitch, is it good? Beautiful Bitch, is it good?” \\n\\nThe white man was an odd, funny sight as he raced around the arena like a \\ndemented Caesar, cheering on his merciless black gladiator. \\n\\nFinally when the show was over and they started to dress, I went to the \\nfront and sat on a stoop next door to the joint. I wanted to get a close up of \\nthe freaks. \\n\\nWhen they got to the sidewalk, in their street clothes, they were \\ndisappointingly normal. Just a clean-cut white couple having a parting chat \\nwith a grinning, black Negro. \\n\\nThe mixed-up couple went down the sidewalk away from me. Party Time \\ncame toward me. He didn’t notice me sitting on the stoop. I was itching with \\ncuriosity, so I hit on him when he came abreast. It startled him. His face got \\nstiff. \\n\\nI said, “Hey Jack, how you doing? That sure is a fine silk girl, huh? You \\ngot a square to spare?” \\n\\nHe fished a cigarette from his red shirt pocket, handed it to me and said, \\n“Yeh Kid, she’s fine as a Valentine. Two sights I ain’t never seen and that is \\n\\n\\n\\na pretty bulldog, and an ugly white woman.” \\n\\nHe was spouting cliches, but to a small town boy he came off witty as Hell. \\nI was in that brain-picking mood so I put the snow machine into high gear to \\nhold him. My eyes bucked in mock awe as I lit the square. \\n\\nI said, “Thanks Man, for the square. Christ! That’s a sporty vine you got \\non. I wish I could dress like you. You sure are clean aplenty.” \\n\\nHe took the bait like a rapist in a nudist colony for the blind. He flopped \\ndown on the stoop beside me. He poked his chest out, his eyes flashing like a \\npin-ball machine gone haywire, as he got ready to open up. He hiked the \\npants legs of his green checked suit to his calves to show his blood red socks. \\n\\nThe huge zircon on his right pinky glittered under the street lamp as he \\ncracked his knuckles and said, “Kid, my name is Party Time. I am the best \\nflat-footed hustler in town. Money loves me and can’t stay away from me. \\nYou see that fine silk broad, I got a double saw to lay her. Course that ain’t \\nnothing, it happens all the time. I could be one of the greatest pimps in the \\ncountry if I was lazy and didn’t have so much good hustler in me.” \\n\\nI sat there listening to his bullshit until two a.m. He was likable and I was \\nhungry for a pal. He was an orphan and he had just done a two-year bit \\nstraight up, his fourth, two months before. He had a head full of wild risky \\nhustles he wanted to try. He needed a partner. He tried all of them on me for \\nsize. \\n\\nI got home at two-twenty. About one minute later I heard Mama’s key in \\nthe door. She had served a banquet for her white folks. I just made it into bed \\nwith all my clothes on, when she came to look in on me. I was snoring like a \\ndrunk with a sick sinus when she kissed me goodnight. \\n\\nI lay thinking in the darkness until daybreak, putting myself into, and \\ntrying to size myself into one of those quick buck schemes that Party had \\nplotted. When the sun came up fat and bright I knew I would give Party’s \\nversion of the Murphy a whirl. I didn’t know his version was crude and \\ndangerous, and only a weak imitation of the real Murphy. \\n\\nYears later I discovered that the Murphy, when played by experts, was a \\nsmooth short con game with a slight risk. In any section where Negro whores \\noperate white men will flock to trick with them. \\n\\nI met Party several times after school at a pool room. He ran my role down \\nto me and the next Friday night we got down with our hustle. Mama was \\nserving a party so I could stay in the streets until at least one a.m. \\n\\nAround ten that night in an alley in the heart of the vice section, Seventh \\n\\n\\n\\nand Vliet Sts., we unwrapped the package that Party had brought. I rolled up \\nmy pants legs beyond my bony knees. I slipped into the twenty-five cent red- \\ncotton dress from the Salvation Army. \\n\\nI put on the frayed red satin high-heel shoes. I pinned a scraggly piece of \\nhair just inside the front inner band of the faded blue straw bonnet. When I \\ntilted it on my head at a sexy angle, the ringlets of uneven hair hung down \\nover my eyes like bangs. \\n\\nI stood wide legged, flexed my thigh and hip muscles against the tight red \\ndress, aping the whores stance. \\n\\nParty looked me over head to toe. I was wondering how I came off as a \\nbroad. He shook his head, hunched his shoulders and walked toward the \\nmouth of the alley to catch a sucker. \\n\\nI got the answer when be reached the sidewalk. He twisted his bead toward \\nme and said, “Listen Man, stay outta the light, okay?” \\n\\nWithin five minutes he gave me the office that some action was coming \\ndown the street. I watched Party giving the pitch to a short elderly white man. \\nI wondered if I had enough voltage as a broad to come through with my end \\nof the deal. \\n\\nHe officed my flash cue an instant before the white man peeked up the \\nalley at me. I jerked my skinny ass in a series of bumps and grinds and \\nhopefully waved him toward me. \\n\\nThat skinny black bitch he saw must have lit a fire in him all right. He \\nfumbled his hide from his hip pocket and handed a bill to Party. \\n\\nThe chump started up the alley at a helluva pace for an old bastard. He had \\npaid his money and he was red hot to take his chance to stick that hot Nigger \\nbitch waiting for him in the shadows. \\n\\nHe had no chance, but in a way he was lucky. Lucky that his hide had not \\nbeen fat with green backs. If he had been loaded, when I evaporated through \\nthat gang way. Party instead of fading away would have come into the dark \\nalley behind the sucker and robbed him with brute force. \\n\\nMy heart was pounding in excitement as I galloped through the alleys \\ntoward our next prearranged duck blind. I took a new station several blocks \\naway. Party Time came moments later, looked up the alley and hooked the \\ntips of his thumb and index fingers into an “all is well” O. \\n\\nWe beat several other suckers. None had the fare for the strong arm. We \\nworked until twelve-thirty, then unlike Cinderella, I stashed my mildewed \\ncostume, got my half of the seventy-dollar take and raced home. Mama came \\n\\n\\n\\nin a half hour after I did. \\n\\nAs in all other things there are many Murphy’s. Real Murphy players use \\ngreat finesse to separate a mark from his scratch. The most adept of them \\nprefer that a trick hit on them. It puts the Murphy player in a position to force \\nthe sucker to “qualify” himself and to trim the mark not only for all of his \\nscratch, but his jewelry as well. \\n\\nWhen approached and quizzed by a mark as to, where a girl can be found, \\nthe Murphy Man will say, “Look Buddy, I know a fabulous house not more \\nthan two blocks away. Brother, you ain’t never seen more beautiful, freakier \\nbroads than are in that house. One of them, the prettiest one, can do more \\nwith a swipe than a monkey can with a banana. She’s like a rubber doll, she \\ncan take a hundred positions.” \\n\\nAt this point the sucker is wild to get to this house of pure joy. He entreats \\nthe con player to take him there, not just direct him to it. \\n\\nThe Murphy player will prat him to enhance his desire. He will say, “Man, \\ndon’t be offended, but Aunt Kate, that runs the house don’t have nothing but \\nhigh-class white men coming to her place. No Niggers or poor white trash. \\nYou know, doctors, lawyers, bigshot politicians. You look like a clean-cut \\nwhite man, but you ain’t in that league are you?” \\n\\nAt this pricking of his ego the mark is ready for the hook. He will protest \\nhis worth as a person and his right to go where any other son-of-a-bitch can \\ngo. Hell for a high class lay a double saw wouldn’t faze him. Few can resist \\nthe charm of exclusivity in its myriad forms. \\n\\nThe con player still hedging, shoring up firmly the convincer will then say, \\n“Man, I believe you and everything you say is true as gospel. In fact, I like \\nyou Pal, but try to see my side of it. First to show you I trust you. I’ll tell you \\na secret. I been working for Aunt Kate’s house for many years now as her \\noutside man, you know, making sure only nice dates went up there. Aunt \\nKate and I got an air tight system. Friend, I know you will help me keep Aunt \\nKate’s roles, so let’s go. I am taking you to the thrill of your life.” \\n\\nWhile keeping up an inflaming description of the whores and sexual \\ndelights to be found only at Aunt Kate’s, the Murphy player had steered the \\nsucker to a pre-chosen neat, attractive apartment building. In the foyer, in a \\nsubtle but compelling manner, the con player nudged the mark into a fast \\nmeeting of minds, the question agreed on. As hot as he was, he couldn’t go \\nup before he checked in all valuables. It was Aunt Kate’s unshakeable rule. \\n\\nAunt Kate was rock right never to tempt or trust a whore. Only fools \\n\\n\\n\\ntrusted whores, right? The mark wasn’t a fool, right? Right! \\n\\nThe con player produced a sturdy brown envelope. The sucker counted all \\nthe scratch in his pocket into the hand of Aunt Kate’s “outside” business \\nmanager. The efficient affable manager shoved it into the envelope, licked it, \\nsealed it, and stuck it in his pocket for safe keeping from the possible larceny \\nin the hearts of the gorgeous dolls upstairs, third floor, first apartment to the \\nleft, number nine to be specific. \\n\\nThe sucker was in a bubbly mood as he took the stairs three at a time. He \\nliked that Nigger down there who was protecting his money. What had he \\ntold him, when he gave him the shiny goldcolored metal check? “Harry, Pal, \\nthis one is on me, just go up and hand it to Aunt Kate. Everything is going to \\nbe all right. If you want you can buy me a drink when you come down.” \\n\\nThe two strikes that had whiffed across the white man’s mental plate and \\nhad set him up for the kill, the third strike was first his desperate need to \\nrelieve himself into a black body, the second was his complete inability to \\nconceive that the “black boy” before him was intelligent enough to fool him, \\nto fashion the Murphy dialogue. \\n\\nParty and his rawboned lure, after three weekends of fair success with the \\nMurphy, ran head on into a round brick balloon. It was only five feet tall, but \\nit weighed close to three-hundred pounds. \\n\\nIt was a Saturday night around ten. The vice section was overrun with \\nJohns. It seemed that every white man in town was out there, scratch in one \\nhand and rod in the other, ripping and running after the black whores with the \\nwidest, blackest asses. \\n\\nParty and I set up a blind on the fringe of the section, because with all that \\nmad action in the center it would be a hectic cat-and-mouse game with the \\ncruising, rousting vice squad. I would have gotten something less than pure \\nkicks to get busted making like a broad. \\n\\nParty hadn’t strong armed since his last bit. The only reason he hadn’t was \\nsimply that none of the Johns we had fleeced was carrying a wad. \\n\\nWe were fishing in a sand pile. All the hungry suckers were swimming in \\ncenter stream. \\n\\nFrom my Murphy station in the alley, I watched Party eagerly for the \\noffice for action. Around eleven-thirty, I was standing on one leg and then the \\nother like a bored crane with a twenty-five cent dress on. \\n\\nAbout five minutes later the office came through. Was it a man? A \\nmachine? No, it was a walking, living, round balloon with a fat poke and a \\n\\n\\n\\nflaming itch for black Cush. It stood there fascinated by my furious bumps \\nand grinds. \\n\\nI felt prickly feet of excitement stomping along my spine when the balloon \\ntook his hide out. Party jerked rigid at the sight of its contents. Even as the \\nballoon bounced toward me, I inched toward my point of evaporation. I knew \\nthe strong-arm lust had exploded inside Party and sure as Hell he was going \\nto come up that alley and smash the air out of the balloon. \\n\\nI quit the scene and poked my head into the alley farther up. I could hear \\nguttural grunting. The kind of sound a heart case makes when he’s riding \\nhard to convince a nympho that he’s a raging tiger. It was the balloon that \\nwas grunting as he held Party in a crushing strangle hold. My heart-beat back \\nfired and melted the starch in my props. I collapsed onto a garbage can. The \\nballoon was also a weight lifter. Poor Party was hanging high over the head \\nof the monster and then flung to the alley floor with a shattering “whoomp” \\nwhere he lay like a rag doll. The balloon hollered as he leaped into the air and \\nthen fell like a ton of concrete on moaning Party. I was almost puking in pity \\nfor Party. But I just couldn’t find the strength to get off that garbage can and \\njoin the fray. Anyway it wouldn’t have been lady like. \\n\\nThe derrick scooped Party from the alley and flung him across his back. I \\nwatched Party’s rubber neck bumping against the balloon’s rear end as he \\nwas carried to the sidewalk. \\n\\nI jetted out of there and went to the roof of my building. I watched for the \\nrollers I was sure were coming to bust me, but they never came. Old Party \\nhad had the funky luck to try the strong arm on a professional wrestler called \\nthe Blimp. \\n\\nParty went back to the joint for a yard after he got out of City Hospital. \\nOne thing about Party he wasn’t copper hearted. He never tipped my name to \\nthe heat. \\n\\nWhen he got older, and lost his nerve to hustle, he got a crazy desire to \\npimp. He wasn’t the type, but he kept trying until he ran the Gorilla game on \\na dope dealer’s broad and was set up for a hot shot. Party tried his fists and \\nmuscle until the pimp game croaked him. The pimp game is like the \\nwatchmaker’s art, it’s tough. Party went through his life struggling to make a \\nwatch while wearing boxing gloves. Party’s bad break sobered me, and I \\nstarted hearing what was going on in day classes at school. \\n\\nAt fifteen, amazingly, I graduated from high school with a ninetyeight \\npoint four average. There was a sizeable alumni of Tuskegee, a Southern \\n\\n\\n\\nNegro college, who insisted upon Mama letting them underwrite all expenses \\nfor my education at their Alma Mater. Mama leaped at the chance. \\n\\nThe alumni went into debt and sent me down to their hallowed school with \\na sparkling wardrobe. They didn’t know I had started to rot inside from street \\npoisoning. \\n\\nIt was like the poor chumps had entered a poisoned horse in the Kentucky \\nDerby and were certain they had a cinch winner. They couldn’t know they \\nhad bet their hearts and blood money on a born loser. \\n\\nA rich bonanza was at stake. The success of my very life itself. The rescue \\nof Mama from her awesome guilt. The trust and confidence of those big- \\nhearted alumni. \\n\\nMy mental eyes had been stabbed blind by the street. I was like a freakish \\njoker who had gotten clap in his eyes from a mangy street whore. \\n\\nOn campus, I was like a fox in a chicken coop. Within ninety days after I \\ngot down there I had slit the maidenhead on a halfdozen curvy coeds. \\n\\nSomehow I managed to get through the Freshman year, but my notoriety \\nwas getting awful. The campus finks were envious, and it was too dangerous \\nto continue to impale coeds on my stake. \\n\\nIn my Sophomore year, I started going into the hills near the campus to \\njuke joints. With my slick Northern dress and manner, I was prince charming \\nin spades to the pungent, hot-ass maidens in the hills. \\n\\nA round butt, bare foot, beauty—fifteen years old—fell hard for me. One \\nnight I failed to meet her in our favorite clump of bushes. I had stuck her up \\nto keep a date in another clump of bushes with a bigger, hotter, rounder ass \\nthan hers. \\n\\nThrough the hill grape vine she got the wire of my double cross. It was \\nhigh noon on campus the next day when I saw her. I had just walked out of \\nthe cafeteria onto the main drag. The street was lousy with students and \\nteachers. \\n\\nShe stood out like a Pope in a cat house. Her potato-sack dress was grimy \\nand dirty as Hell from the long trip from the hills. Her bare feet and legs were \\nrusty and dusty. She saw me a wild heart-beat after I saw her. \\n\\nShe battle-cried like an Apache Warrior, and before I could get the wax out \\nof my props, she had raced close enough toward me so that I could see the \\ninsane fury in her eyes. \\n\\nBeads of sweat clung to the kinky hair in the pit of her arm that was \\nupraised, gripping like a dagger a broken Coca Cola bottle, the jagged edges \\n\\n\\n\\nwere glinting in the sun. \\n\\nThe screaming teachers and students fled like terrified sheep in the wake of \\na panther. I don’t remember what athlete was reputed to be the fastest human \\nin the world that year, but for those few seconds after I got the wax out of my \\nlegs, I was. \\n\\nWhen I finally looked back through the cloud of dust, I saw the crazy \\nbroad as a speck in the distance behind me. \\n\\nMine had been a carpet offense and I was on it in the office of the school \\nPresident. \\n\\nI stood before him, seated behind his gleaming mahogany desk. He cleared \\nhis pipes and gave me a look like I had jacked off before the student body. He \\nheld his head high. His nose reaching for the ceiling like I was crap on his top \\nlip. \\n\\nIn a sneaky Southern drawl he said, “Boy, yu ah a disgrace to oauh fine \\ninstitushun. Ah’m shocked thet sech has occurred. Yo mothah has bin \\ninfaumed of yo bad conduck. Oauh bord is considurin yo dismissul. En thu \\nmeantime, keep yo nos clean, Boy. Yo ah not to leave campus for eny resun.” \\n\\nI could have saved my worry over dismissal. That alumni had powerful \\npull all right. I got a break and got the chance to stay until mid-term of the \\nSophomore year when I went for the “okey doke.” I took a bootlegging rap \\nfor a pal. “What goes around comes around” old hustlers had said. Party had \\ntaken our beef without spilling. \\n\\nAnything with a buzz in it was in great demand on campus. A pint of rot \\ngut whiskey brought from seven and a half to ten dollars depending on \\nsupply. My roommate had scratch and a Fagin disposition. He was a sharpy \\nfrom a number-racket family in New York. \\n\\nWe made a deal. He would bank roll our venture if I copped the \\nmerchandise and sold it. He got my promise that I would keep his part in it a \\nsecret. He was a fox for sure. \\n\\nHe gave me the scratch and I slipped up into the hills to contact a \\nmoonshiner who would supply me. Perhaps I don’t have to say that I \\ncarefully avoided any contact with that broad who pushed me to that track \\nrecord. \\n\\nI scored for a connection and the markup on campus was fourhundred \\npercent. \\n\\nEverything was beautiful. The merchandise was moving like crazy. I was \\nsure that when I got back home for the summer I would have enough scratch \\n\\n\\n\\nto turn everybody green with envy. \\n\\nI recruited a coed I had layed to distribute for me in her dorm. It was the \\nbeginning of the end. \\n\\nThere were two jasper coeds in her dorm who were fierce rivals for the \\nlove of a coffee-colored, curvaceous doll from a country town in Oklahoma. \\nThe doll was really dumb. She bad no idea of the lesbian kick, so naturally \\nshe couldn’t know she was a target. \\n\\nEventually, the craftier of the two jaspers wore the doll down and turned \\nher out. They had to keep the secret of their romance from the other jasper \\nbecause she was tough and built like a football player. She was doing money \\nfavors for the doll hoping to get into her pants. The doll and her jockey were \\nin cahoots playing the sucker jasper hard for the scratch. \\n\\nOne night the doll and her jockey were tied into a pretzel doing the sixty- \\nnine and drunk as Hell on my merchandise, when their passionate outcries \\nreached the ears of the muscular jasper. \\n\\nThe bloody fight and spicy details were topics for state-wide gossip. \\n\\nIn the heat of the investigation my agent fell apart. She put the finger on \\nme and within a week I was on the train going back to the streets for good. I \\ndidn’t turn over on my roommate. I obeyed the code. \\n\\nMama changed jobs a week after I got back, to nurse and cook for a \\nwealthy, white recluse. Now I really stuck my nose in the devil’s ass. \\n\\nMama had to stay on the place. I saw her once a week, on Sunday, when \\nshe would come in for a day. That was the only time I stayed at the hotel. \\n\\nI had found a fascinating second home, a gambling joint run by a broken \\ndown ex-pimp and murderer called Diamond Tooth Jimmy. The two-carat \\nstone, wedged between the upper front rotting teeth, was the last vulgar \\nmemento of his infamy as the top ass-kicker of the nineteen-twenties. \\n\\nHe boasted endlessly that he was the only Nigger pimp on Earth who had \\never pimped in Paris on French girls. I was to discover later, when I would \\nmeet and be trained by the Master, that Jimmy was a mere buffoon, an \\namateur not fit to hold the Master’s coat. \\n\\nAfter the suckers were trimmed and all the shills had been paid, Jimmy \\nwould lock the door and then like a ritual, light up a thin brown reefer. As he \\ntalked, he would pass it to me, cursing me affably for not inhaling deeply and \\nholding the smoke, as he put it, “deep in my belly.” \\n\\nWhen dawn broke he would go out through the joint door home to the \\nnineteen-year-old jasper on whom he lavished furs and jewels. He was a real \\n\\n\\n\\nsucker. \\n\\nI would go to bed in the tiny cubicle in the rear of the joint and dream \\nfantastic dreams. Always beautiful whores would get down on their knees \\nand tearfully beg me to take their money. \\n\\nFor several months I had been screwing the luscious daughter of a popular \\nband leader. She was fifteen. Her name was June and she had a wild yen for \\nme. She had a habit of waiting down the street from the gambling joint until \\nJimmy left, then she would come up and get on the army cot with me. She \\nwould stay until seven o’clock at night. She knew I had to clean the joint for \\naction around nine. \\n\\nOne day, around noon, I asked her, “Do you love me enough to do \\nanything for me?” \\n\\nShe said, “Yes.” \\n\\nSo, I said, “Even turn a trick?” \\n\\nShe said, “Anything.” \\n\\nI put my clothes on and went to the street and saw an old gambler whom I \\nknew was a trick and told him what was upstairs. Sure enough he gave me a \\nfive-dollar bill, the asking price, and I took him upstairs and let him in on her. \\nShe turned him in less than five minutes. \\n\\nMy seventeen-year-old brain reeled. This was still the depression. I could \\nget rich with this girl and drive a big white Packard. \\n\\nMy next prospect was all wrong. He was an acquaintance of the band \\nleader, June’s father. He went up the stairs, saw her and called the father in \\nPittsburgh. \\n\\nThe father called the local police department and my pimping career died \\naborning. When the detective came, I was still out there looking for tricks for \\nthe down payment on that big white Packard. \\n\\nDiamond Tooth’s bullshit had screwed me for certain. My mother, of \\ncourse, was shocked. She was sure it was a frame up. That June, that evil girl, \\nhad led her sweet little Bobby astray. \\n\\nAt the County Jail two days before my trial, I left my cell on an Attorney \\nConsultation pass. A short, gopher-faced Negro sat in the cage at an old oak \\ndesk grinning at me. \\n\\nMy blood ran cold, my palms got slippery wet as I took a seat across from \\nhim. The gleaming yellow gold teeth filling his mouth had been a flash of \\ndoom. Christ! I thought, a deep South Nigger lip. Didn’t Mama know that \\nmost of them turned to jelly when defending a criminal case? \\n\\n\\n\\nThe rodent wiped his blue-black brow with a soggy handkerchief and said, \\n“Well Bobby, it seems that you are in a little trouble, huh? I am attorney \\nWilliams, an old friend of your family. I knew your mother as a girl.” \\n\\nMy eyes sent special delivery murder across the table to that ugly bastard. \\n\\nI said, “It isn’t a little trouble. Under the Max I could get a fin’.” \\n\\nHe fingered his dollar necktie and hoisted his starved shoulders inside the \\njacket of his cheap vine and said, “Oh! Now let’s not be fatalistic. You are a \\nfirst offender and I am positive it will mitigate the charge. Rest assured I will \\npress the court for leniency. Now tell me the whole truth about your trouble.” \\n\\nAnger, everything drained out of me. I was lost, stricken. The phony would \\nlead me to the slaughter. I knew I was already tried and convicted and \\nsentenced to the joint. The only loose end was for how long? Without hearing \\nit myself, I ran down the details to him and stumbled blindly back to my cell. \\n\\nOn my trial day in the courtroom, the shaky bastard was so nervous before \\nthe bench when he pleaded me guilty, that the same cheap vine that he had \\nworn at our first meeting was soaked by his sweat. \\n\\nHe was so shook up by the stern face and voice of the white hawk-faced \\njudge that he forgot to ask for leniency. That awful fear the white folks had \\nput into him down South was still painfully alive in him. He just stood there \\nparalyzed, waiting for the judge to sentence me. \\n\\nSo, I looked up into the frosty blue eyes and said, “Your Honor, I am sorry \\nfor what I did. I have never been in trouble before. If Your Honor will just \\ngive me a break this time, I swear before the Lord I won’t ever come back \\ndown here. Please, Your Honor, don’t send me to the pen.” \\n\\nThe frost deepened in his eyes as he looked down at me and intoned, “You \\nare a vicious young man. Your crime against that innocent young girl, against \\nthe laws of this state, is inexcusable. The very nature of your crime precludes \\nthe possibility of probation. For your own good and for that of society’s I \\nsentence you to the State Reformatory to a term for not less than one year, \\nand for not more than eighteen months. I hope it teaches you a lesson.” \\n\\nI shrugged off the wet hand of the lip from my shoulder, avoided the tear- \\nreddened eyes of Mama sobbing quietly in the rear of the courtroom, and \\nstuck my hands out to the bailiff for the icy-cold handcuffs. \\n\\nJune’s old man was a big wheel with lots of muscle in the courts. He had \\ngone behind the scenes and pulled strings and put the cinch on the joint for \\nme. My sentence was for carnal knowledge and abuse, reduced from \\npandering, because you can’t pander from anything except a whore, and \\n\\n\\n\\nJune’s old man wasn’t about to go for that. \\n\\nYes, I was sure working at that first patch of gray in my mother’s hair. \\nSteve would have been proud of me, don’t you think? \\n\\nMy sentence to the Wisconsin Green Bay reformatory almost cracked \\nMama up. \\n\\nThere were several repeaters from the reformatory on my tier at County \\nJail, who tried to bug the first offenders with terrible stories about the hard \\ntime up at the reformatory, while we were waiting for the van to take upstate \\nto the reformatory. I was too dumb to feel anything, A fool I was to think the \\ndummy was a fairy tale! \\n\\nIn the two weeks that I waited. Mama wrote me a letter every day and \\nvisited twice. Mama’s guilt and heartbreak were weighing heavily on her. \\n\\nBack in Rockford she had been a dutiful church goer, leading a Christian \\nlife until Steve came on the scene. But now when I read her long rambling \\nletters crammed with threats of fire and brimstone for me if I didn’t get Jesus \\nin my heart and respect the Holy Ghost and the fire, I realized that poor \\nMama was becoming a religious fanatic to save her sanity. The pressures of \\nHenry’s death and now my plight must have been awful. \\n\\nThe van came to get us on a stormy, thunderous morning. As we stepped \\ninto the van handcuffed together I saw Mama standing in the icy, driving rain \\nwaving good-bye. I could feel a hot throbbing lump at the base of my throat \\nto see her standing there looking so sad and lonesome, cowering beneath the \\nbattering rain. I could feel the tears aching to flow, but I couldn’t cry. \\n\\nMama never told me how she found out the time the van would come. I \\nstill wonder how she found out and what her thoughts were out there in the \\nstorm as she watched me start my journey. \\n\\nThe state called it a reformatory, but believe me it was a prison for real. \\n\\nMy belly fluttered when the van pulled into the prison road leading to the \\njoint. The van had been vibrating with horse play and profane ribbing among \\nthe twenty-odd prisoners. Only one of them had sat tensely and silently \\nduring the entire trip. The fat fellow next to me. \\n\\nBut when those high slate grey walls loomed grimly before us it was as if a \\ngiant fist had slugged the breath from us all. Even the repeaters who had \\nserved time behind those walls were silent, tight faced. I started to believe \\nthose stories they had told back in County Jail. \\n\\nThe van went through three gates manned by rock-faced backs carrying \\nscoped, high-powered rifles. Three casket-gray cell houses stood like mute \\n\\n\\n\\nmourners beneath the bleak sunless sky. For the first time in my life I felt \\nraw, grinding fear. \\n\\nThe fat Negro sitting next to me was a former schoolmate of mine in high \\nschool. He had been a dedicated member of the Holiness Church then. \\n\\nI had never gotten friendly with him because his only interest at that time \\nseemed to be his church and Bible. He didn’t smoke, swear, chase broads or \\ngamble. He had been a rock-ribbed square. \\n\\nHis name was Oscar. Apparently he was still square because now his eyes \\nwere closed and I could hear bits of prayer as he whispered softly. \\n\\nOscar’s prayer was abruptly cut off by the screech of the van’s brakes as it \\nstopped in front of the prison check-in station and bath house. We clambered \\nout and stood in line to have our handcuffs removed. Two screws started at \\neach end of the line unlocking the cuffs. \\n\\nAs they moved toward the middle of the line they stifled the thin whispers \\nof the men. They said to each man, “Button it up! Silence! No talking!” \\n\\nOscar was shaking and trembling in front of me as we filed into a brightly- \\nlit high-ceilinged room. A rough pine counter stretched for twenty yards \\ndown a green-and-gray flagstone floor that looked clean enough to eat from. \\nThis was part of the shiny, clean skin of the apple. The inside was rotting and \\nfoul. \\n\\nCons with starch-white faces stood behind the long counter guessing our \\nsizes as we passed them and passing out faded pieces of our uniform from \\ncaps to brogans. \\n\\nWe passed with our bundles into a large room. A tall silent screw, dazzling \\nwith brass buttons and gold braid on his navy-blue uniform, slashed his lead- \\nloaded cane through the air like a vocal sword directing us to put our bundles \\non a long bench and to undress for short arm inspection, and a brief exam by \\nthe prison croaker seated at a battered steel desk in the back of the room. \\n\\nFinally we all had been checked by the croaker and showered. The gold- \\nspangled screw raised his talkative cane. It told us to go out the door and turn \\nleft, then straight ahead. Two screws marched alongside as we made it toward \\na squat sandstone building two-hundred yards away. Was that talking cane \\nthe dummys? \\n\\nI heard it before I saw it. A loud scraping, thunder laced with a hollow \\nroar. Never before had I heard anything like it. Then mysteriously, in the \\ndimness, countless young grim faces seemed to be bobbing in a sea of gray. \\nA hundred feet ahead I saw the mystery. Hundreds of gray-clad cons were \\n\\n\\n\\nlock stepping from the mess halls into the three cell houses. They were an \\neerie sight in the twilight, marching mutely in cadence like tragic robot \\nsoldiers. The roaring thunder was the scrape and thump of their heavy prison \\nbrogans. \\n\\nWe reached the squat building. We were to stay in its quarantine cells for \\nthe next ten days. All fish, new cons, were housed here to be given a \\nthorough medical check out and classification before being assigned to work \\ndetails out in population. \\n\\nI got a putrid taste of the inside of that apple when cons in white uniforms \\nand peaked caps gave us our supper through a slot in our cell doors. It was \\nbarley soup with a hunk of brown bread. It would have made great shrapnel \\nin a grenade. \\n\\nI was new and learning, so instead of just gulping it down, I took a long \\nclose look at the odd little things black-dotted at one end. I puked until my \\nbelly cramped. The barley in the soup was lousy with worms. \\n\\nThe lights went out at nine. Every hour or so a screw came by the row of \\ncells. He would poke the bright eye of his flashlight into a cell and then \\nsquint his eyes as he looked into each cell. I wondered if it were a capital \\ncrime in this joint to get caught having an affair with “lady five fingers.” \\n\\nI flapped my ears when I heard one of the white repeaters running down \\nthe joint in a whisper to a fish. Oscar was listening too because he had \\nstopped praying in his cell next to mine. \\n\\nThe white fish was saying, “Look Rocky, what the Hell gives with that \\nhack in the bath house? Why don’t the jack-off never rap? What’s with that \\ncane bit?” \\n\\nThe repeater said, “The son-of-a-bitch is stir crazy. His voice-box screwed \\nup on him a dime ago. He’s been the brass nuts here for a double dime, and \\nguess how the bastard lost his rapper?” \\n\\nThat screw and his light was making the rounds again, so the repeater got \\non the dummy. \\n\\nWhen the screw had passed he continued, “The creep was called Fog Horn \\nby the cons before his trouble made him a dummy. They say the bastard’s \\nbellows could be heard from one side of the joint to the other. He’s the \\nmeanest captain of screws this joint ever had. In the last double dime he has \\ncroaked two white cons and four spades with his cane. He hates Niggers.” \\n\\nOscar was praying like mad now. He had heard what the repeater said \\nabout those four Negroes. The fish wanted a loose end tied for him. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe said, “Yeh Rocky, just to glim him and you know he’s rough, but what \\nin the Hell cut his box off?” \\n\\nThe repeater said, “Oh! The vine has it he treated his wife and Crumb \\ncrusher worse than he did the cons. She got her fill of his screwing and \\ndrilled herself and the kid through the head. The little broad was only two \\nyears old. The note his broad left said, T can’t stand your hollering any \\nlonger. Good-bye.’ A head-shrinker here at the time said when the broad \\ncroaked herself it shut off Brass Nuts box.” \\n\\nI lay there thinking about what the con had said. I thought about Oscar and \\nwondered if he could pull his bit or if he would go back to his parents in a \\npine box, or worse, to the crazy farm. \\n\\nOscar had been sentenced to a year by the same-judge that had socked it \\ninto me. Oscar, poor chump had started going with a crippled Irish girl of \\nseventeen. \\n\\nIn the dark balcony of a downtown theatre they were seen smooching by \\nthe son of a close friend of the girl’s family. He reported post haste to his \\nparents who wired up the girl’s parents. They were Irish, with temper and \\nprejudice. \\n\\nThey third-degreed the girl and she confessed that old black Oscar had \\nindeed trespassed the forbidden valley. The charge of statutory rape naturally \\nstood up and here was old Oscar next door to me. \\n\\nI slapped the itching sting on my thigh. I pulled the sheet back. Lord, have \\nmercy! How I hated them. It was a bed bug I had smashed, but he was only a \\nscout. When that flashlight jarred me awake an hour later, a division of them \\nwas parading the walls. \\n\\nI lay wide-eyed until morning. The inside of that shiny apple was really \\nsomething else. \\n\\nAfter all our tests we fish were taken out of the quarantine tank on the \\ntenth day to the Warden’s office. My turn came to go in. I got up from the \\nlong bench in the hall outside his office and walked in. My knees were \\nhaving a boxing match as I stood before him. \\n\\nHe was a silver-maned, profane, huge, white bull with two tiny chunks of \\nblack fire rammed deep into his eye sockets. \\n\\nHe said, “Well Sambo, you sure got your black-Nigger ass in a sling, \\ndidn’t you? Well understand me, we didn’t send for you, but you came. We \\nare here to punish you smart-aleck bastards, so if you fuck around, two things \\ncan happen to you, both of them horrible. We got a hole here that we bury \\n\\n\\n\\ntough punks in. It’s a stripped cell without light, twenty feet below ground. \\nDown there, two slices of bread and a pint of water twice a day. You can go \\nout that North gate in a box for your second choice. So take this rulebook and \\nstudy it. Now get your rusty black ass out of my face.” \\n\\nThe only thing I said before I eased out of there was, “Yes Sir, Boss Man,” \\nand I was grinning like a Mississippi rape suspect turned loose by the mob. \\n\\nIt was a wise thing I had uncled on him. One of those arrogant repeaters \\nwent to the hole for having a sassy look in his eyes. The charge was “visual \\ninsubordination.” \\n\\nOscar and I were assigned to work and live in cell block “B.” It was all \\nblack. Of the three, it was the only one without toilets. We had buckets in \\ncells that we took out each morning and dumped into running water in a \\ntrough behind the cell block. \\n\\nThe only stench in my life I have ever smelled that was worse than that cell \\nblock on a warm night was a sick hype. \\n\\nIt was rough all right and a terrible battle of wits. The battle mainly \\ncentered around staying out of sight and trouble with the dummy. He walked \\non the balls of his feet and he could read a con’s mind. It was terrifying to \\nhave maybe a slice of contraband bread in your bosom, and then from \\nnowhere have the dummy pop up. \\n\\nHe didn’t pass out an instruction leaflet running down the lingo of that \\ncane. If you misunderstood what it said, the dummy would crack the leaded \\nshaft of it against your skull. \\n\\nAfter I had put in six months on my bit, a young Negro con came in on \\ntransfer from the big joint and brought me a wire from Party. \\n\\nHe sent word that we were still tight and I was his horse if I never won a \\nrace. \\n\\nIt felt good to know he had forgiven me for turning chicken back there in \\nthe alley with the balloon. \\n\\nThe dummy hated everybody. He felt something much more frightful for \\nOscar. \\n\\nI don’t know whether it was that the dummy had a hate for God too, and he \\nknew how religious Oscar was, and had focused all his hate on a living target. \\n\\nOscar and I shared a double bunk cell. I had the bottom bunk. It was a \\nchilling sight at night when the dummy should have been at home to look up \\nfrom a book and see him out there on the tier motionless, staring up at Oscar \\nin his bunk reading the Bible. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was sure that the cold, luminous, green eyes had slipped away for \\nthe night, I would crack, “Oscar, my man, I like you. Will you take some \\ngood advice from a friend? I am telling you Pal, it’s driving the dummy off \\nhis rocker to see you reading that Bible. Pal, why in the Hell don’t you stop \\nreading it for your own good?” \\n\\nThat square jerk would go on reading, he hadn’t even noticed the dummy’s \\nvisit. \\n\\nHe would say, “I know you are my friend and I appreciate your advice, but \\nI can’t take it. Don’t worry about me. Jesus will protect me.” \\n\\nMama was writing at least once a week. Every month she visited me. On \\nher last visit, without worrying her too much, I suggested it would be a good \\nidea to put in a long-distance call to the Warden once a week just so he would \\nknow somebody out there loved me and wanted me to stay healthy. \\n\\nShe was looking fine and had saved her money. She had opened a beauty \\nshop. She told me when I came up for parole she was sure a friend of hers \\nwould give me a job. At night after her visits I would lie sleepless all night \\nmentally recapping our sad lives. I could still remember too, every mole and \\ncrease in Henry’s face. \\n\\nOne night after one of her visits, the radio loud speaker on the cell house \\nwall blared out “Spring Time in the Rockies.” I tried to keep my crying a \\nsecret from Oscar, but he heard me. He marked off a chapter in the Bible for \\nme to read, but with the dummy around, I wasn’t about to do something \\nstupid like that. \\n\\nThe dummy put one over on Jesus and busted Oscar. We had almost \\nfinished mopping the flag when the cell house runner brought me two \\nwieners from the kitchen. A pal had sent them. \\n\\nI gave Oscar one. He stuck it inside his shirt I stood my mop against the \\nwall and ducked into an empty cell and wolfed mine down. \\n\\nWe had finished mopping and were at the supply closet putting our mops \\nand buckets away. Oscar was nibbling slowly on his wiener like he was safe \\nand sound at the “Last Supper.” \\n\\nI saw the giant shadow glue itself against the wall next to the closet door. I \\nlooked through the trap door in the corner of my eye. The universe reeled. \\n\\nIt was the dummy. He saw the piece of wiener in Oscar’s hand. The \\ndummy’s green eyes were oscillating. \\n\\nThat deadly cane razored through the air and cut a slice of hair and bloody \\nflesh from the side of Oscar’s head. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe scarlet glob was hanging by a slimy thread of flesh dangling like an \\nawful earring near the tip of his ear lobe. Oscar’s eyes walled toward the back \\nof his head as he moaned and slipped to the flag. From the grey, whitish core \\nof the wound spouts of blood pulsed out. \\n\\nThe dummy just stood there looking down at the carnage. His green eyes \\nwere twinkling in excitement. I had seen him every day for eight months. I \\nhad never seen him smile. He was smiling now like he was watching two cute \\nkittens frolicking. I stooped to help Oscar. I felt feathery puffs of air against \\nmy cheek. The cane was screaming. The dummy was furiously waggling it \\nbeside my head. It was screaming, “Get out!” \\n\\nI got. I lay in my cell wondering if the dummy had second thoughts and \\nwould try for two. I heard the voices of the hospital orderlies on the flag \\ntaking Oscar away. \\n\\nI remembered the murderous force of the blow the dummy had struck. I \\nremembered that pleased look on his face. I knew from con grape-vine that \\nhe was from Alabama. I knew now it hadn’t been Oscar’s Bible that had put \\nthe dummy’s balls in the fire. The dummy knew about that crippled Irish girl. \\n\\nOscar went from the hospital into the hole for fifteen days. The charges, \\n“possession of contraband food” and “physical aggression against an officer.” \\nI was there and the only aggression on Oscar’s part was the natural resistance \\nof his flesh and bone to that steel cane. \\n\\nThe parole board met in the joint every month to consider applications. \\nEvery con, when he had served to within several months of his minimum, \\nstarted dreaming of the street and that upcoming parole consideration. \\n\\nOscar was in the hole and I missed his company. He was a square, but a \\nnice one with lots of wry wit. Several cons slightly older than I came in on \\ntransfer from the big joint. They claimed to be “mack” men. \\n\\nIn bad weather, when there was no yard recreation, I would join them at a \\ntable on the flag. I didn’t talk much. I usually listened. I was fascinated by the \\nyarns they spun about their pimping ability. They had a lot of bullshit, and I \\nwas stealing as much as I could from them to use when I got out. \\n\\nI would go back to my cell excited. I would pretend I had a whore before \\nme. I would stand there in the cell and pimp up a storm. I didn’t know that \\nthe crap I was rehearsing wouldn’t get a quarter in the street. \\n\\nOscar came out of the hole and was put into an isolation cell on the top tier \\nof the cell house. I didn’t see him come in so I wasn’t prepared when I got a \\nchance to go up there. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I got to the cell with his number in the slot, a skinny joker was \\npeeing in his bucket with his back to me. He was in a laughing fit. I checked \\nthe number in the slot again. It was Oscar’s number all right. \\n\\nI pulled the key to the supply closet across the bars of the cell door. The \\nskeleton jumped and spun around facing me. His eyes were wild and vacant. \\nIt was Oscar. Only that livid bald scar on the side of his head made me sure. \\n\\nHe didn’t seem to remember me so I said, “How are you, Pal? I knew they \\ncouldn’t stop a stepper.” \\n\\nHe just stood there, his dingus flopping from his open fly. \\n\\nI said, “Jack, you are going to give your bright future the flu if you don’t \\nget it out of the draft.” \\n\\nHe ignored my words, and then from the very bottom of his throat I could \\nhear a kind of eerie high pitched humming or keening, like maybe the mating \\ncall of a werewolf. I was beginning to worry about him. I was standing there \\ntrying to figure something to say to get through to him. He hadn’t been out of \\nthe hole for more than two hours. Maybe some loose circuit would jar him \\nback to contact. \\n\\nI knew he had been destroyed when he gave me a sly look and went to the \\nback of his cell. He picked up his bucket and thrust his hand into it. \\n\\nHe brought out a fist full of crap. He scraped the crap from his right palm \\ninto the rigid upturned left palm. \\n\\nUsing his left palm as a kind of palette, he dipped into the crap with his \\nright index finger and started to finger paint on the cell wall. \\n\\nI just stood there in shock. Finally, he stopped, snapped to attention, \\nsaluted me and stuck his chest out proudly and pointed a crappy finger at his \\nart on the wall. \\n\\nThere was an idiot’s look of triumph on his face like he had finished the \\nSistine Chapel ceiling. \\n\\nI gave up on him. I went downstairs and told the cell house screw. \\n\\nThe next day they shipped Oscar to the funny farm where perhaps he is \\ntoday, thirty years later. \\n\\nMy time went fast after the eighth month. I had gone before the parole \\nboard and I was waiting for my pink slip. A white one meant denial and a \\nnew date for consideration. \\n\\nI saw the mail clerk when he shoved it through the bars of my cell. I leaped \\nup and grabbed the small brown envelope. My hands shook so badly, it took \\nseconds to rip it open. It was pink! I banged my fists against the steel wall of \\n\\n\\n\\nmy cell. I was so happy I couldn’t feel pain. \\n\\nThey dressed me out in a cheap glen-plaid suit. I would have been thrilled \\nto have left that den of pressure in tar and feathers. On the way out I had to \\nface the bull. \\n\\nWhen I walked into his office he said, “Well Snowball, you must have had \\nyour rabbit’s foot. So long, see you in a couple of weeks.” \\n\\nI wasn’t out yet so I gave him the same uncle smile going out that I gave \\nhim coming in. \\n\\nWhen I walked out of the joint the fresh air was like a blast of oxygen. It \\nmade me woozy. I turned and looked back at the joint. The dummy was \\nstanding at the chapel window staring at me, but for once that steel cane \\nwasn’t talking to me. \\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\nSALTY TRIP WITH PEPPER \\n\\n\\nFirst thing back in Milwaukee, I reported to my parole officer, a Mr. Rand, I \\nthink. After asking a thousand questions and filling out a mountain of papers \\nhe gave me an I.Q. test. When he computed my score his sea-blue eyes \\nsaucered in surprise. \\n\\nHe couldn’t understand how a boy with a score of one-hundred and \\nseventy-five could do a stupid thing like peddling a girl’s ass on the sidewalk. \\n\\nIf that I.Q. test had been on the basis of the half-baked criminal, pimping \\ntheories that I had picked up in the joint at that table from those Chili pimps \\nthat were churning in my mind, and that I was so eager to try, my score \\nwould have been zero. \\n\\nI was eighteen now, six feet two inches tall, slender, sweet, and stupid. My \\nmaroon eyes were deeply set, dreamy. My shoulders were broad and my \\nwaist as narrow as a girl’s. \\n\\nI was going to be a heart breaker all right. All I needed was the threads and \\na whore. \\n\\nMama’s small, lucrative beauty shop was on the main drag. Poor Mama, \\nshe was doomed I guess to inadvertently set up my disasters. \\n\\nI had started on my job delivering for the drugstore owned by the friend of \\nmy Mama’s who had hired me to satisfy the parole condition of a job upon \\nrelease. \\n\\nAs fate would have it. Mama’s shop and the drugstore were in the same \\nbuilding. Mama and I lived in an apartment over the storefronts. \\n\\nMama called me in from the sidewalk one day about three months after I \\nhad gotten parole. She wanted me to meet one of her customers who was \\ngetting her eyebrows arched. I walked through the pungent odors rising from \\nthe hot pressing combs pulling through the kinky hair of several customers, to \\n\\n\\n\\nthe rear of the shop. \\n\\nThere she was, flashy as a Christmas tree, sitting before a mirror at a \\ndressing table with her back to me. Mama stopped plucking at her brows as \\nshe introduced us, “Mrs. Ibbetts, this is my son Bobby.” \\n\\nLike a yellow cat hypnotizing a bird, she sat there motionless, her green \\neyes smoky, as she stared at me through the mirror. \\n\\nThen the velvet purring voice undulated toward me, she said, “Oh Bobby, I \\nhave heard so much about you. It’s so exciting to meet you, but please call \\nme Pepper, everyone does.” \\n\\nI don’t know what excited me more as I stood there, her raw sensuality or \\nthe blazing rocks on her tapered fingers that I was sure hadn’t come from \\nKresges. I mumbled something like I had to go back to the drug store to \\nwork, and I would see her around. \\n\\nLater I saw her slide into her sleek Caddie convertible, her white silk dress \\nriding up exposing the satin sheen of her banana yellow thighs. As she \\ngunned away from the curb, she turned deliberately and gave me a full dose \\nof those hot green eyes. She was signing our deal. \\n\\nI quizzed around and got the background on her. She was twentyfive, an \\nex-whore who had worked the jazziest houses on the Eastern Seaboard. A \\nwealthy white fence and gambler had tricked with her out there, and it had \\ngotten so good to him that he crossed her pimp into a five-year bit and \\nsquared her up. \\n\\nThree days later, a half hour before closing, an order came in for a case of \\nMums. The address was in the plush Height’s, miles from the store. \\n\\nI made the trip on a bicycle. She answered the door wearing only a pair of \\nwhite lace step-ins. My erection was hard and instant. \\n\\nIt was a fabulous pad, and the lights were soft and blue. The old man \\nwouldn’t be back for a week. \\n\\nI was just a hep punk, I wasn’t in her league, but one of my greatest assets \\nhas always been my open mind. That freak bitch cajoled and persuaded me to \\ndo everything in the sexual book, and a number of things not even listed. \\n\\nWhat a thrill for a dog like her to turn out a tender fool like me. She was a \\nhell of a teacher all right, and what a performer. If Pepper had lived in the old \\nBiblical city of Sodom the citizen’s would have stoned her to death. \\n\\nShe nibbled and sucked hundreds of tingling bruises on every square inch \\nof my body. Fair exchange, as the old saw goes, is never robbery. \\n\\nIt took me a week to get the stench of her piss out of my hair. She sure had \\n\\n\\n\\nbeen pimped on hard back East. She hated men, and she was taking her \\nrevenge on me. \\n\\nShe had taught me to snort girl, and almost always when I came to her pad, \\nthere would be thin sparkling rows of crystal cocaine on the glass top of the \\ncocktail table. \\n\\nWe would snort it through alabaster horns and then in the mirrored \\nbedroom we made circus love until our nerve ends shrieked. \\n\\nPepper and that pure cocaine would have made a freak out of a Priest. She \\nhad sure put me on a fast track. \\n\\nI couldn’t know at the time that at the end of the line stood the grim State \\nPenitentiary. \\n\\nI was green all right and twice as soft and Pepper knew it. Here was a \\nhardened ex-whore who knew all the crosses, all the answers, who handled \\nlots of scratch and wasn’t laying a red penny on me. \\n\\nThe dazzling edge on our orgies was dulling for me, but I was flipping \\nPepper with the techniques she had taught me. I knew all the buttons to push \\nfor her, and she burned hotter than ever for her little puppy. \\n\\nNo wonder, I was freaking for free, those Eastern pimps had charged her a \\nfortune. \\n\\nI tried one night to get a C note from her for a suit. I knew I had really \\ncome on fine in the bed. She had almost climbed the walls in her passion. \\n\\n“Sugar,” I said, “I saw a wild vine for a bill downtown. If you laid the \\nscratch on me, I could cop tomorrow.” \\n\\nShe slitted her green eyes and laughed in my face, and said, “Now listen \\nLil’ Puppy, I don’t give men money. I take it from them, and besides, as \\nsweet as you are to this pussy, you don’t need a suit. I like you as you are, \\nwith no clothes on at all.” \\n\\nI was a rank greenhorn, sure, but her cold turn down of my plea for the C \\nnote was bitchy cute, and I was a salty sucker, so I reacted like any stupid \\nwould-be pimp who had been Georgied. \\n\\nI had fouled up basic business. I had led with my dick instead of my mitt. \\n\\nI reached down and slapped her hard against the side of her face. It \\nsounded like a pistol shot. On impact a thrill shot through me. I should have \\nslugged her with a baseball bat. \\n\\nThe bitch uncoiled from that bed like a striking yellow cobra, hooked her \\narms around my waist and sank her razor sharp teeth into my navel. \\n\\nThe shock paralyzed me. I fell on my back across the bed moaning in pain. \\n\\n\\n\\nI could feel blood rolling from the wound down toward my crotch, but I \\ncouldn’t speak. I couldn’t move. \\n\\nPepper was sure a strange twisted broad. She was breathing hard now, but \\nnot in rage. The violence, the blood, had turned her on. \\n\\nShe was gently caressing me as she licked, with a feathery tongue, the \\noozing wound on my belly. She had never been so tenderly efficient as she \\ntook me on a beautiful “trip around the Universe.” \\n\\nThe funny thing was, that throbbing awful pain some how became a part \\nof, melted into the joy of the feathery tongue, the thrill of the thing that \\nPepper was doing to me. \\n\\nI guess Freud was right. If it thrills you to give pain, you can get your \\njollies taking it. \\n\\nWhen I left Pepper, I was sapped. I felt like an old man. My mood was as \\nbleak and cheerless as the gray dawn I cycled through. \\n\\nWhen I got home and looked into the mirror, a death’s head stared back at \\nme. That vampire bitch was sucking my life’s blood all right. I also knew that \\ncrystal cocaine wasn’t exactly a health tonic. \\n\\nPepper was too fast, too slick for me. I had to make her shit or get off the \\npot. \\n\\nI made the skeleton in the mirror a solemn vow that before the week was \\nout I would in some way get Weeping Shorty, a pimp about fifty-five who, \\nwhile a gorilla pimp, was the best pimp in town to pull my coat to give me a \\nplan for putting a ring in Pepper’s nose. \\n\\nBefore I got busted, I had seen him at Jimmy’s joint. He had looked \\nhorrible then, and now less than a year and a half later he looked like a \\nbreathing corpse. \\n\\nHoss was his Boss. He had chippied around and gotten hooked. It was \\nFriday, almost midnight when I found him. \\n\\nHe looked at me and made that clacking sound against the roof of his \\nmouth with his tongue. You know, that mischievous, weirdly joyful sound \\nthat a young kid makes the instant before he rams a hat pin into your ear \\ndrum. \\n\\nThen he said, “Well kiss my dead mammy’s ass, if it ain’t Macking \\nYoungblood. The whore’s pet and the pimp’s fret.” \\n\\nThe junkie bastard was jeffing on me, lashing me with contempt and scorn. \\nOld pimps always know when a youngster with a yen for the pimp game is \\ndesperate for advice. \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, they remember when they started and what a bitch it was just to \\nlearn the million questions. The answers would come slowly, from heart \\nbreaking trial and error, from the ass kissing of the few who had solved the \\nriddle, who pimped by the book. \\n\\nThe cleverest pimp could give a thousand years and never come close to all \\nthe answers. \\n\\nWeeping Shorty was an old man, and he had gotten past the questions and \\nhad worked out a few answers, but even so he knew a thousand times more \\nthan I did. So, I fought for control, I couldn’t show anger. If I did he would \\ncut me loose. \\n\\nWe had been standing under the awning of a vacant storefront. He pulled \\nme with a jerk of his head, I followed him to a big shabby Buick. It was \\nparked at an intersection in a cheap-trick district. \\n\\nWhen we got inside the Buick I understood why he had parked it there. He \\ncould watch and keep tabs on his stable of scrawny, junkie whores working \\nthe four corners of the intersection. \\n\\nHe sat under the wheel not saying anything. His eyes straight ahead. I had \\nkissed his ass for a half hour and now he was freezing up. I thought of the \\ntiny pile of cocaine wrapped in tinfoil under my instep that I had filched from \\nPepper. I fished it out and held it in my hand. Perhaps the cocaine would \\nopen him up. \\n\\nI turned to him and said, “Weeping, do you want a light snort of girl?” \\n\\nHe stiffened like a butcher knife had been run into his back. He looked at \\nthe wad of tinfoil in my palm and snatched it and in the same motion hurled it \\nthrough the window on his side. \\n\\nHis top was blown, he shouted, “Nigger, ain’t you got no sense? You \\ntrying to go back to the joint and blow my wheels?” \\n\\nI said, “What did I do wrong? All I did was to offer the C just to be \\nsociable. What’s wrong with that?” \\n\\nHe said, “Sucker, first booty butt, you don’t transport no hard in your \\nstomp, keep it in your mitt so you can down it fast to the turf. Second, you’re \\non parole. You’re hot! You ain’t got no business sitting dirty in my short. \\nThere’s a law, Sucker, that can confiscate a short with stuff in it. You know if \\nthe heat had hit on you you would unload in my short. Keep stuff off you. \\nWhen you stop somewhere down it in the street until you ready to split. It’s \\nbetter to get beat for the stash than beat by the heat. Now what took your \\nhead outta Pepper’s ass long enough for you to look me up?” \\n\\n\\n\\nOh! How this junkie creep bugged me. I sat there beside him trying to \\nthink of questions that would bleed him so I could get out of his face fast. He \\nlooked exactly like a withered baboon. His breath stunk like he had just eaten \\na bowl of maggots. \\n\\nI said, “Weeping, Pepper hasn’t got my nose open for her. She’s too jazzy \\nand slick for me. I came to you because everybody knows that your game is \\nmellow. I want you to pull my coat so I can pimp some scratch out of her.” \\n\\nThe baboon liked that banana I threw him. He was ready to talk the pimp \\ngame. \\n\\nHe said, “The suckers in Hell want ice water, but it’s late for them. They \\nain’t never going to get no ice water. The way you start with a bitch is the \\nway you end with a bitch. You can start pimping hard on a bitch and then \\nsucker out and blow her, but ain’t no way you can turn it around and pimp on \\nPepper after starting with her like a sucker. Forget her and get down on a \\nfresh bitch.” \\n\\nI said, “You mean there is no way to get any scratch out of her?” \\n\\nHe said, “Now you see I didn’t say that. I said you couldn’t pimp any \\nscratch outta her. A foxy cold-blooded stud can always find an angle to cross \\na broad outta scratch.” \\n\\nI said, “I’m not foxy, but I think I could be cold blooded enough to cross \\nthat slick bitch Pepper. Weeping, you are the fox. Lay some game on me and \\nput me to the test. I’ll split any scratch I take off right down the middle with \\nyou.” \\n\\nI hadn’t noticed it was raining. Now it was raining hard enough so that \\nWeeping had turned to run up the window on his side. He had just raised it \\nand was about to answer my proposition when there was a frantic rapping on \\nhis window. It was one of his whores. \\n\\nThrough the closed window of the locked door she said loudly, “Daddy, \\nopen the door! My feet are soaked. Nothing is happening out here tonight, \\nand besides I am hot as Hell. The vice is watching me. It’s Costello. He told \\nme to get off the street or he would bust me. Please open the door.” \\n\\nWeeping was a cold gorilla all right. He sat there for a long moment. His \\nmonkey face was tight and hard. He casually opened the wind wing as the \\nrain beat down on his whore. She stuck her nose through it. \\n\\nWithout moving toward the wing, sitting erect in the car seat he hollered, \\n“You bullshit Bitch, make something happen. You a whore, you suppose to \\nbe hot. Let Costello bust you. He can’t make a beef stand up unless he \\n\\n\\n\\nketches you with a trick. You dumb chickenhearted bitch, whatta you think I \\ngot this ass pocket full of ‘fall’ scratch for? Now get out there and work. \\nDon’t worry about the rain. Walk between the rain drops. Bitch.” \\n\\nHe slammed the wing shut. \\n\\nHer face was wild and angry through the murky glass. Her doperotted teeth \\nwere ragged fangs in the dimness as she pressed her face close to the glass. \\n\\nShe screamed, “You just lost a girl. You had four, now you got three. I’m \\ncutting you loose. Shorty.” \\n\\nWeeping let his window down and stuck his head out into the rain as she \\nwalked away. He was all gorilla now. \\n\\nHe screamed, “Bitch, I give you odds you won’t split. As much of my dope \\nyou been shooting, I’m playing ketch up. You rank Bitch, you know if you \\nsplit I’ll find you and stick my knife in your stinking ass and gut you to your \\nbreast bone.” \\n\\nI wondered if he had lost her. He read my mind. \\n\\nHe said, “She ain’t going nowhere, look at this.” \\n\\nHe turned his car engine on and started the windshield wiper so we could \\nsee the street. There she was back out there in the rain whistling and waving \\nat the passing cars. \\n\\nHe switched the engine off. \\n\\nHe said, “That bitch knows I ain’t jiving. She’ll make me some scratch this \\nmorning. Now Youngblood, about Pepper. You don’t know anything about \\nher. You ain’t long out of the joint. I like you, so my advice is the same I \\ngave you at first. Forget her. Try in another spot.” \\n\\nWhat he said about my not knowing her made me curious. \\n\\nI said, “Look Weeping, I know you like me, and if you do, run Pepper \\ndown for me.” \\n\\n“Did you know that peckerwood of Pepper’s is the bankroll behind the \\nbiggest policy wheel in town?” \\n\\nI said, “No, but if the old man is flush isn’t that good. Why give Pepper up \\nbecause she’s in shape. If you gave me an angle I could get some of that \\npolicy scratch.” \\n\\n“Look Blood, brace yourself. Here is the rest of the rundown. Pepper is a \\nrotten freak broad. You ain’t the only stud she freaks off with. I could name a \\nhalf dozen who ride her. The dangerous one is Dalanski the detective. He is \\nin a bad way over Pepper. If he ever found out you were freaking off with \\nher, Blood, shame on your ass.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI was shaken by the rundown. Like a sucker I believed that I was the whole \\nshow in her love life. I was thinking like the young punk I was. \\n\\nI said, “Are you sure there are that many studs laying her?” \\n\\nHe said, “Maybe more.” \\n\\nI had a bellyache and a worse headache. I felt lousy. \\n\\nI mumbled, “Thanks for the advice and the run down, ‘Weeping.’” I got \\nout of the Buick and walked home in the rain. When I got there it was three \\nthirty and Mama was angry, worried and raving. She was right of course. I \\nwas violating my parole to be out after eleven p.m. \\n\\n\\nI was coming out of the drug store to make a delivery when I bumped into \\nhim on the sidewalk. It was old “Party Time.” \\n\\nWhile doing his year for our caper he had copped a lonely-hearts broad \\nthrough the mails. \\n\\nShe went his train fare. He finished the bit and went to visit her and made a \\nhome. \\n\\nShe had died and the home went to relatives who threw him out. After five \\nbits he was still full of crooked inspiration. I liked him, but not enough to join \\nhim again in a hustle. I had only been out four and a half months. I cooled it \\nand avoided him in a smooth way. \\n\\nI hadn’t touched Pepper in a week. She had called the drug store twice just \\nbefore closing. She had made licking and sucking sounds to get me out to her \\nplace. I made excuses and put her off. I wondered at the time why I was so \\nimportant when she was a douche bag for that mob that was laying it into her. \\n\\nThe day before Weeping brought me a proposition, Dalanski, the roller, \\ncame into the drug store for cigarettes and gave me a thoughtful look. \\n\\nI was walking home. It was my day off. It was Saturday night around nine. \\nI had been to see a prison movie. It was a grim drama. A young green punk \\ntried a double cross. He was criss-crossed into the joint. He made deadly \\nenemies while doing his long bit. \\n\\nWhen he got out, a long black short pulled up and riddled him with a \\ntommy gun. \\n\\nA big black car was pulling to the curb toward me. There was something \\nfamiliar about that small pinhead driver. It was Weeping. \\n\\nHe jerked his head and opened the car door. I went over and got in. He was \\n\\n\\n\\nexcited. At first I thought because his car was clean. \\n\\nHe told me, “Blood, put a smile on your face. Old Shorty’s got good news \\nfor you. How would you like a half a G in your slide?” \\n\\nI said, “All right, give me the poison and take me to the baby.” \\n\\nHe said, “I ain’t shucking. It’s cream-puff work. In fact Tender Dick, it’s \\nwhat you like to do best. Want the run down?” \\n\\n“If you are going to tell me some broad is going to lay out fivehundred \\nfrog skins to get her rocks off, say it. I would lay a syphillis patient that died \\na week ago for that kind of scratch.” \\n\\nThen he said, “Pepper is the broad. All you have to do is take her to bed \\nand go through a full circus with her, that’s all. Are you game?” \\n\\n“Yes, if I get a rake off from the bleacher seats, I said, “and you tell me \\nwho wants the show on.” \\n\\nHis eyebrows jitterbugged. He was a slick joker. I should have run from \\nhim. \\n\\nHe said, “No, I can’t tell you who. Don’t worry about the scratch, it’s \\nguaranteed. Are you in?” \\n\\nI said, “Yes, but I want to know more. Like why?” \\n\\nThe tale he told me went like this. A fast hustler from New York who \\nspecialized in pressure rackets saw a chance to trim Pepper’s old man out of a \\nbundle. \\n\\nThe hustler knew that Pepper was a dog and a freak. He also knew that \\nPepper’s old man was hung up on her. \\n\\nEven though he had met her in a whorehouse and squared her up, he was \\ndangerously jealous of her and unpredictable if he caught her wrong. \\n\\nThe hustler felt that Pepper would be in a sweet state for pressure if solid \\nevidence could be gotten showing Pepper as the dog she was. \\n\\nThe hustler was sure he could force her to help him in his scheme to trim \\nthe old man. He needed clear unfaked photographs. \\n\\nHis plan would be simple. Once he got the club over Pepper’s head, he \\nwould force her to sneak in phony “hit” slips against the policy wheel. \\n\\nThe hustler had discovered that for Pepper, from her inside position in the \\nwheel, it would be very simple. \\n\\nThe hustler would pay me five bills after I had brought Pepper to a \\nprearranged set up. \\n\\nI was all for the scratch, and eager to give Pepper some grief for the way \\nshe had used me, and outslicked me. \\n\\n\\n\\nWeeping told me the trap was set. I was to wait until Pepper itched enough \\nto call me. I was not to call her. \\n\\nWhenever she called I was to tell her to meet me in the bathroom of an old, \\nbut still elegant hotel on the fringe of the arcade and shooting gallery section \\nof town. \\n\\nI was then to call him. I was to make sure that at least two hours passed \\nbetween her call and when I went to the desk and asked for the key to \\napartment two-fourteen. My name would be Barksdale. That name I’ll never \\nforget if I live to get a hundred. \\n\\nOn the third day after I had gotten the rundown on the trap, Pepper called \\nthe store. It was eight fifty-five p.m., five minutes before closing. I answered \\nthe phone. She was burning blisters for one of our parties. \\n\\nShe invited me to her place as usual. I told her that I had to tidy up the \\nstore and also mail an important package at the downtown post office for my \\nboss. \\n\\nI asked her if she could get dressed and meet me by ten-thirty in the bar \\nroom of the hotel. It would be more convenient that way. She agreed. \\n\\nI called Weeping. He told me to maneuver Pepper’s face toward the head \\nof the bed as much as possible when we got into the act. \\n\\nI went to the bar room and drank rum and coke until she got there. \\n\\nI almost felt sorry for her when I saw her coming through the door. She \\nlooked so innocent and clean, not at all like the cruddy filly that humped up a \\nfunky lather beneath a mob of jockeys. \\n\\nWe took a booth so I could watch the clock. She was Jacqueline the Ripper \\nwith a fly, but she had a great gentle touch inside if you know what I mean. \\n\\nShe was a space buff all right. She was checking out my readiness for entry \\ninto inner space. \\n\\nAt eleven sharp Mr. and Mrs. Barksdale picked up the key to their pad. We \\nwalked onto the stage. \\n\\nWyatt Earp would have gone ape over the pad. \\n\\nIt was overstuffed horse-hair living room. Gleaming brass bed, giant \\ncherubs on the wall, Gideon Bible on the marble top bedroom table. Midget, \\nefficiency kitchen cubicle. So what, we hadn’t come to cook. \\n\\nHigh on the wall over the bed were the two gold colored cherubs. Their \\neyes were holes, their mouths popped wide holding the light fixtures. \\n\\nWhen we got into the brass bed we got the show on the road. \\n\\nI was almost sure some steamed up joker in the adjoining room had his \\n\\n\\n\\ngizmo focused on the carnival through a drilled hole peeking from a cherub’s \\nempty eye socket. \\n\\nPepper let me out of her Hog at one-thirty in the a.m. just two blocks from \\nWeeping’s whore stand. I felt good. I was going to collect five fat ones for \\nmy pleasant night’s work. It was like having a license to steal. \\n\\nI spotted Weeping’s pin-head in his Buick. As I walked toward him, I \\ncouldn’t stop thinking about that Eastern blackmailer. I thought about that \\ngreen rain that would fall when Pepper started rolling those phony hits in. I \\nthought about how I could catch a few palms full. \\n\\nSmooth as silk the pay-off came off. When Weeping handed me my \\nscratch he gave me a funny look. \\n\\nHe said, “Take it easy Blood, take it easy.” \\n\\nThe next day I went downtown and got clean. \\n\\nIt was the early years for the Nat “King” Cole Trio. They were playing for \\na two-buck dance that night at Liberty Hall. Party and I were in the balcony at \\na table overlooking the crowded dance floor. We were slaving like sand hogs \\ntrying to tunnel into the flashy high yellows on our laps. They were almost \\nstoned. Ready for the killing floor. \\n\\nParty saw him first coming in the front door of the auditorium. He knifed \\nme in the side with his elbow. \\n\\nThen con style, from the side of his mouth, he whispered, “Dalanski, the \\nheat.” \\n\\nThe bastard’s head was on a swivel. He was looking everywhere at once. I \\nfelt mad butterflies with stingers ricocheting in my belly when his eyes \\nspotted me and locked on me. I froze, his eyes were still riveted to me as he \\nwalked up the stairway straight for me. \\n\\nI pretended to ignore him. He walked up behind me and stood there for a \\nlong moment. Then he dropped a hand like an anvil on my shoulder. \\n\\nHe said, “Get up! I want to talk to you.” \\n\\nMy legs were shuddery as I stood in a small alcove with him. \\n\\nHe said, “Where were you around ten and after last night?” \\n\\nRelief and courage flooded me. That was easy; I hedged. \\n\\n“Why?” \\n\\nHe said, “Look punk, don’t get cute. Where were you? Don’t answer. I \\nknow where you were. You were out on Crystal Road in the nighttime \\nburglarizing the home of Mr. and Mrs. Lrank Ibbetts. Night-time burglary is \\nfive to ten.” \\n\\n\\n\\nMy courage and relief swiftly drained out. Frank Ibbetts was Pepper’s old \\nman. He was roughly frisking me now. He ran his hands into my side \\npockets. With one hand he brought out the three hundred dollars left from my \\npay-off, plus twenty clean dollars. The other came out with a strange brass \\ndoor key. \\n\\nHe said, “Jeez, for a flunky in a drug store you got a helluva bankroll. \\nWhere did you get it and where and what does this key fit?” \\n\\nI said, “Officer, that’s crap-game money. I have never seen that key \\nbefore.” \\n\\nHe grabbed me firmly like he had captured Sutton and walked me through \\nthe dancers out the door to his short. \\n\\nHe took me down and booked me on suspicion of Grand Theft burglary. \\nHe also booked the scratch and key as evidence. \\n\\nMama came down bright and early the next morning. She was in a near \\nfainting dither. She was clutching her chest over her heart. \\n\\nShe said, “Bobby, you are going to kill your mama. You haven’t been out \\nsix months and now you are back in trouble. What’s wrong with you? Are \\nyou crazy? You need prayer. Get down on your knees and pray to the good \\nLord.” \\n\\nI said, “I don’t need to pray. Mama, believe me there is nothing to worry \\nabout. I didn’t steal anything from Pepper’s house. I am not nuts. Pepper will \\ntell them the truth. Mama, I was with her.” \\n\\nI got my first nightmare inkling of the cork-screw criss-cross when Mama \\nbroke into tears. She rolled her eyes to heaven. \\n\\nShe blubbered, “Bobby, there’s no hope for you. You are going to spend \\nyour young life in prisons. Don’t you know Son, your mama loves you? You \\ndon’t have to lie to me.” \\n\\n“I went out to see her early this morning,” she said. “She told me she \\nhasn’t seen you in a week. Mr. Dalanski has brought Pepper’s spare key \\ndown here. That key in your pocket was one you stole when you made a \\ndelivery out there.” \\n\\nFinally, she went down the corridor. Her shoulders were jerking in her \\nsobbing. \\n\\nIt was an iron cross. My public defender went to that hotel to get \\ncorroboration for my alibi. The joint had been too crowded, too hectic. None \\nof the employees remembered Pepper and me. At least they said they didn’t. \\n\\nThe desk man on that night had been a substitute and wasn’t now \\n\\n\\n\\navailable. My signature wasn’t on the register anyway. \\n\\nI went into court again with the dirty end of the stick. I was a parolee \\narrested at one a.m. with a bottle of whiskey in front of me in a public place. \\n\\nPepper looked like a prospect for a convent. She had stripped herself of \\npaint and gee-gaws. She testified that the key found in my slide was her’s, \\nand that yes, it was possible that I had stolen it while making deliveries to her \\nhome. No, she had not seen me for a week before my arrest. \\n\\nMy defender had gotten a change of venue. I was afraid to go before the \\njudge who had sent me to the reformatory. \\n\\nI got two years in state prison for grand theft, the amount, fivehundred \\ndollars. My parole was to run concurrently with the new sentence. \\n\\nPepper’s old man was with her in court. They bought the cross. I couldn’t \\nfigure who had sold it to them. \\n\\nWas Dalanski the joker that Weeping worked for? Or had Dalanski heard \\nthat I had a wad, and without knowing anything about the hotel affair sold it \\nto Pepper? \\n\\nFor what reason had the old man bought it? Had those hotel employees \\nbeen bribed or threatened? If Dalanski was the brain, did he want me out of \\nthe way for a reason other than Pepper? \\n\\nMaybe some day I’ll find out what really happened. I know if I had had \\nlots of scratch Miss Justice would have smiled on me. She favors the bird \\nwith the scratch. \\n\\nThe Waupun State Prison was tough, but in a different way than the \\nreformatory. Here the cons were older. Many of them were murderer’s \\nserving life sentences. \\n\\nThese cons would never put up with the kind of petty tyranny that was \\npracticed in the reformatory. Here the food was much better. There were \\nindustries here. A con could learn a trade if he wanted to. \\n\\nHe could go into the yard during recreation hours and learn other trades \\nand skills. Here the desperate heist men congregated to plot new, more \\nsensational robberies. The fruits and punks lay on the grass in the sun \\nromancing each other. \\n\\nThis was a prison of cliques, of bloody vendettas. I found my level with \\nthe soft spoken smooth Midwestern pimps and stuff players. \\n\\nSince I was one of the youngest cons in the joint I bunked in a dormitory. \\nIt was like a suite in the Waldorf compared to the bug infested tight cells in \\nthe reformatory with their odious crap buckets. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was there in that dormitory that I got the insatiable desire to pimp. I was \\na member of a clique that talked about nothing except whores and pimping. I \\nbegan to feel a new slickness and hardness. \\n\\nI worked in the laundry. I kept my clothing fresh and neat. It was in the \\nlaundry that I met the first man from whom I got cunning to balance my \\nhardness. \\n\\nHe was an old Drag man with his bit getting short. He was the first to \\nattempt to teach me to control my emotions. \\n\\nHe would say, “Always remember whether you be sucker or hustler in the \\nworld out there, you’ve got that vital edge if you can iron-clad your feelings. \\nI picture the human mind as a movie screen. If you’re a dopey sucker, you’ll \\njust sit and watch all kinds of mindwrecking, damn fool movies on that \\nscreen.” \\n\\nHe said. “Son, there is no reason except a stupid one for anybody to project \\non that screen anything that will worry him or dull that vital edge. After all, \\nwe are the absolute bosses of that whole theatre and show in our minds. We \\neven write the script. So always write positive, dynamic scripts and show \\nonly the best movies for you on that screen whether you are pimp or priest.” \\n\\nHis rundown of his screen theory saved my sanity many years later. He \\nwas a twisted wise man and one day when he wasn’t looking, a movie flashed \\non the screen. The title was “Death For an Old Con.” \\n\\nHe died in his sleep behind the high gray walls. His fate was that which \\nlives like a specter with all cons. The fear of dying in a cell. \\n\\nI sure missed that convict philosopher. The wisdom he taught me took me \\nsuccessfully through my bit. I was released after twenty-one months. I got \\nthree months “good time” for good conduct. \\n\\nWith “good time” I was free, hard, slick and bitter. No more small towns \\nfor me. I was going to the city to get my degree in pimping. \\n\\nThe Pepper cross had answered a perplexing question for me. Why did \\nJustice really always wear a blindfold? I knew now. It was because the \\ncunning bitch had dollar signs for eyeballs. \\n\\n\\n\\n4 \\n\\nA DEGREE IN PIMPING \\n\\n\\nWhen I got back to Milwaukee, Mama, and the street, my mind was \\nstraitjacketed into the pimp game. Back in the joint I had dreamed almost \\nnightly. They were cruel playets. \\n\\nThey were fantastic. I would see myself gigantic and powerful like God \\nAlmighty. My clothes would glow. My underwear would be rainbow-hued \\nsilk petting my skin. \\n\\nMy suits were spun-gold shot through with precious stones. My shoes \\nwould be dazzling silver. The toes were as sharp as daggers. Beautiful \\nwhores with piteous eyes groveled at my feet. \\n\\nThrough the dream mist I would see huge shaped stakes. The whore’s \\npainted faces would be wild in fear. They would wail and beg me not to \\nmurder them on those sharp steel stakes. \\n\\nI would laugh madly. Springs of scarlet would spurt from their behinds as I \\njoyfully booted them crotch first onto the sharp pikes. They would flop \\naround like dying chickens. They would finally fall away in a welter of blood \\ninto two red halves. \\n\\nWhen I awoke my ticker would be earthquaking inside me. The hot volley \\nof the savage thrill lay sticky set between my trembling thighs. \\n\\nI had other terrible dreams. I would be very tiny. A gargantuan Christ in a \\nsea of light would be towering above me. In his anger his eyes would be \\nblazing blue suns. His silky platinum hair would stand on end in his rage. \\n\\nA shaft of purest white light would shoot from the tip of his index finger. \\nHe would point toward a woman. Her back would be turned to me. He would \\nhand me a barbed leather whip. \\n\\nLike a crash of summer thunder he would command, “Punish this evil \\nwoman. Destroy the devil inside her. The Lord so directs thee.” \\n\\n\\n\\nEagerly I would grab the heavy whip in both hands. I would bring it down \\nwith all my force on the woman’s back. She would just stand there. The \\nscarlet would drain down from her slashed back. She would be standing to \\nher knees in a river of blood. \\n\\nShe would turn her brown agonized face toward me. It would be Mama. I \\nwould be shaking and screaming in my sweat. It was horrible. I could never \\ncut the dream off until its end. It had to run its fearful course. The dreams \\nabout Mama came until her death. \\n\\nFor a day or two following them, these dreams would recreate in day¬ \\ndreams. Sudden dark arrows of depression and regret would stab into that \\nopen sore in my mind. I would get high. The narcotics seemed to ward off \\nlike armor the stealthy arrows. \\n\\nAfter a week of rest and Mama’s soulfood, my color and strength came \\nback. On a Saturday night I decked myself out in one of the vines and topcoat \\nI had bought the day before Dalanski busted me. \\n\\nI remembered the pimp rundowns at the joint. I had learned my first step \\nhad to be a fast cop. I needed a whore to hit the city scene. I had to get on that \\nfast track to pimping. \\n\\nI was only several months away from age twenty. My baby face was gone. \\nI was six feet two. I was as thin as a greyhound on a crash diet. I went into an \\nunderworld bar. The 711 Club, crowded with pimps, whores, and thieves. \\n\\nI stood at the far end of the bar stalling with a coke. I faced the front door. \\nI turned and asked the slightly familiar elephant beside me about Weeping \\nand Party. \\n\\nHe turned his head. His dime-sized eyes got stuck in my fly’s zipper as he \\nlooked me over head to toe. He remembered me. \\n\\nHe said, “About a month ago your boon coon Party caught sixty in the \\ncounty. One of them tight pussys opened his nose wide enough to drive a \\nfreight train through. He caught a stud whamming it into her. The stud quit \\nthe scene. The broad had to go to a croaker to get Party’s shoe outta her ass.” \\n\\nThen after pausing to thumbnail a ball of snot from his trunk, he said, “Old \\nWeeping fell dead outside a shooting gallery in Saint Paul. Musta’ shot some \\npure, cause a lookout on the sidewalk heard him mumble before he croaked. \\nWell kiss my dead mammy’s ass if this ain’t the best smack I ever shot.” \\n\\nThe elephant again raised his hoof toward his filthy trunk. The sissy \\nbarkeep sat a fresh bottle of coke on the log before me. I yanked my \\neyebrows into a question mark. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe lisped, “The runty black bitch in the middle of the bar sent you a taste.” \\n\\nWithout taking my eyes off his thin yellow face, I said, “Sugar, run her \\ndown to me. Is the bitch qualified? Is she a whore? Does she have a man?” \\n\\nThe corners of his mouth see-sawed. He slugged his soggy, dirty bar rag \\nagainst my reflection on the bat top. \\n\\nHe almost whispered, “The bitch ain’t nothing but a young skunk from \\nSaint Louis. She ain’t nothing but a jazzy jive whore. I’m more whore than \\nshe is. She ain’t got no man. She’s a come freak She’s Georgied three bullshit \\npimps since she got here a month ago. If your game is strong you could play \\na hog outta her ass. She ain’t but eighteen.” \\n\\nI eased a bone from my pocket, put it on the bar for the fresh coke. I \\nfrantically remembered those pimp rundowns in the joint. \\n\\nI said, “Tell the bitch no dice. I’ll take care of the little things, and if she is \\nqualified maybe I’ll let her take care of the big things. Give the bitch a drink \\non me.” \\n\\nOn the juke box Ella Fitzgerald was crying about her “little yellow basket.” \\n\\nThe bar keep twinkle-toed toward her with the wire and drink. Through the \\nblue mirror I zeroed my eyes in on the target. My ass bone starched on stiff \\npoint. Her big peepers were two sexy dancers in the velvet midnight of her \\ncute Pekingese face. \\n\\nHot scratch fever streaked through me. I thought, if I could cop her and get \\na pimp’s terms she would be out of pocket poison to all white tricks that \\npinned her. \\n\\nThose pimps back in the joint sure knew basic whorology. I was glad my \\nears had flapped to all those rundowns. \\n\\nThey had said, “Chase a whore, you get a chump’s weak cop. Stalk a \\nwhore, you get a pimp’s strong cop.” \\n\\nMy turn down of her measly first offer had her jumpy. It was a slick sharp \\nhook twisting in the bitch’s mind. Her juicy tongue darted out like a red \\nlizard past her ivory teeth. It slithered over the full lips. She wiggled toward \\nme in an uneven race with the bar keep. He was sliding her green drink \\nbetween me and the elephant. \\n\\nI heard a low excited trumpeting in the trunk of the elephant. He had dug \\nher flawless props and gourmet rear end. It was rolling inside her glove-tight \\nwhite dress. \\n\\nI painted a lukewarm indifferent grin on my face as she perched on the \\nstool. I noticed a roll of scratch wedged deep between the black peaks. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, “Who the hell are you, and what is that ‘off the wall’ shit you \\ncracked on the bartender?” My eyes were sub-zero spotlights on her face. I \\nsaid, “Bitch, my name is Blood, and my wire wasn’t ‘off the wall.’ It was \\nreal, like me. Bitch, you sure got a filthy, sassy job. It could get your ass \\nruptured.” \\n\\nThe big vein at the temple in the tiny dog face quivered. Her rapper was \\nshrill. \\n\\nShe bleated, “I ain’t no bitch. I’m a mother-fucking lady. The stud ain’t \\nbeen pulled outta his mammy’s womb that kicks my ass. Goddamnit, call me \\nPhyllis. Be a gentleman and respect me. I’m a lady.” \\n\\nThe icy blasts busted the thermostat in my spotlights. \\n\\nI could feel my cool spit on my lips as I roared, “You stinking black Bitch, \\nyou’re a fake. There’s no such thing as a lady in our world. You either got to \\nbe a bitch or a faggot in drag. Now Bitch, which is it? Bitch, I’m not a \\ngentleman, I’m a pimp. I’ll kick your funky ass. You gave me first lick. \\nBitch, you’re creaming to eat me up. I’m not a come freak, you are. I’m a \\nfreak to scratch.” \\n\\nMy blast had moved her. Those joint rundowns sure worked. I could see \\nthose sexy dancers were hot as hell there in the midnight. She was trying to \\nconceal from me the freakish pain-loving bitch inside her. \\n\\nShe was comical like that fire-and-brimstone preacher. He was trying to \\nhide his hard-on from the cute sister in the front pew flashing her cat for him. \\n\\nThe broad was speechless. I had called all the shots. I turned toward the \\ncrapper. \\n\\nAs I walked away I bombed her. I said, “Bitch, I’m splitting when I come \\nout of that crapper. I know your pussy is jumping for me. I know you want \\nme for your man. Some lucky bitch is going to steal me from you. You better \\ntoss that bullshit out of your mind. Get straight Bitch, and tell me like it is on \\nmy way out. You had your chance. After tonight you don’t have any.” \\n\\nInside the crapper I ripped a wad of paper from its holder. I wrapped the \\nsaw buck and the four singles around it. Whatever happened out there, I had \\nto show a bankroll. \\n\\nI stood there in the crapper. I was letting the heat seep deep into that bitch \\nout there. Was I going to cop my first whore? My crotch was fluttery at the \\nthought of it. \\n\\nI walked out of the crapper. She was outside the door. I almost trampled \\nher. I ignored her. I walked to the bar to pay my light tab. She was peering \\n\\n\\n\\nover my shoulder. I peeled the saw buck off. \\n\\nI told the barkeep, “Steal the change and cop a hog.” \\n\\nHis bedroom gray eyes sparkled. His delicate pinkie scooted the saw buck \\nback to me across the log. \\n\\nHe said, “Sweetie, it’s on me. Come back at two and cop a real girl.” \\n\\nShe tugged at my sleeve as I turned from the bar. She looked up at me. \\nThose dancers had stripped. \\n\\nI looked down at the hot runt and said, “Well Bitch, it’s your move. Do I \\ncut you loose?” \\n\\nShe grabbed my shoulder. She pulled me down toward her. I could feel her \\nhot breath on the side of my head. She popped that lizard tongue into my ear \\nalmost to my eardrum. It sent hot shivers through me. I stayed cool. I turned \\nmy head and knifed my teeth into the side of her neck. I don’t know why she \\ndidn’t bleed. She just moaned. \\n\\nThen she whispered, “You cold-blooded sweet mother-fucker, I go for you. \\nLet’s go to my pad and rap.” \\n\\nWe walked to the slammer. I glanced back. The elephant was staring at us. \\nHis tongue was frenching his chops. His trunk was twitching for a party. \\n\\nOn the sidewalk she handed me the key to her yellow thirty-six Ford. I was \\nlucky. I had been taught to drive the laundry truck back in the joint. The \\nFord’s motor sang a fine tune. It wasn’t a pimp’s “wheels,” but it sure would \\nmake the trip to the city track. \\n\\nI drove to her pad. On the way she played on me. She was setting me up \\nfor the Georgia. That lizard thought my ear was a speedway. It did a hundred \\nlaps inside it. I was still green. I shouldn’t have let her touch me. \\n\\nHer pad was a trap for suckers all right. She had pasted luminous white \\nstars on the hotel room’s blue ceiling. There was one blue light. It glowed \\nsexily from behind a three-foot plaster copy of Rodin’s “The Kiss.” \\n\\nThere was a mirror over the bed. There were mirrors on the walls flanking \\nthe bed. There was a polar-bear rug gleaming whitely in front of a blue chaise \\nlounge. \\n\\nI sat on the lounge. She flipped on the portable record player. Ellington \\nrippled out “Mood Indigo.” \\n\\nShe slipped into a cell-sized bathroom. Its door was half shut. The peke \\nwas digging a washcloth into her armpits and cat. She was nude. She sure \\nwas panting to swindle me out of my youth. I wondered if and where she had \\nstashed that roll of scratch. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe came out belly dancing to the “Indigo” sex booster. She was a runt \\nWatusi princess. Her curvy black body had the sheen of seal skin. I had one \\nbitch of a time remembering the dialogue that covered this kind of a situation. \\n\\nWhat had the pimps in the joint said: “You gotta back up from them \\nfabulous pussys. You gotta make like you don’t have a swipe. You gotta keep \\nyour mind on the scratch.” \\n\\n“Stay cold and brutal. Cop your scratch first. Don’t let ’em Georgia you. \\nThey’ll laugh at you. They’ll cut you loose like a trick after they’ve flim- \\nflammed you. Your scratch cop is the only way to put a hook in their stinking \\nasses.” \\n\\nShe danced toward the head of the bed. She stooped over and raised the \\nedge of the red carpet. Her rear end swayed to the “Indigo.” It was grinning at \\nme. It was theatre in the round for sure. \\n\\nShe danced toward me. She had two thin reefers in her hand. That box at \\nthe side of the bed had rejected and “Indigo” was encoring. \\n\\nShe stood between my legs. Even through the trouser cloth I could feel the \\nhot dampness of her outer thighs. The inner surface of my kneecaps tingled \\nunder the heat. \\n\\nShe quivered and rolled her jet satin belly under my nose. Her humming of \\nthe “Indigo” was low and throaty. She sure qualified as the package the \\npimps had warned about. My twenty-one month cherry was aching to chunk \\nout. \\n\\nShe took a lighter off the cocktail table. She ran the sticks in and out of her \\nmouth to get an even burn. She lit them and handed me one. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, this is light green pot from chili gut country. It will \\nmake us mellow. Why don’t you take your clothes off?” \\n\\nI took a deep pull on the stick of reefer. I looked up into the sultry dreamy \\neyes. \\n\\nI parroted, “Bitch, don’t put shit in the game. Business always comes \\nbefore pleasure in my book. I’ll take my clothes off when I know I’m taking \\nthem off with my whore. I don’t sucker for the Georgia. Jar loose from \\nrespectable scratch, Bitch.” \\n\\nI had heard it verbatim in the joint. It worked like a lie detector. The motor \\nin her belly threw a rod. Her eyes had a far away look. \\n\\nShe was busy tailoring the con for me. She collapsed to a yogi squat on the \\npolar bear rug. Her moon was winking at me. Her voice was bullshit sweet. \\n\\nShe warbled, “Sweetheart Daddy, you already shot me down. I’m your \\n\\n\\n\\nsweet bitch. I got a C note coming from a trick with his nose open for me. \\nHe’ll spring for it tomorrow night. It’s yours, but you got to wait. Now come \\non and put your freak baby to bed.” \\n\\nMy system had been clean. The reefer was powerful. She didn’t know how \\ndesperately I needed to pimp. She couldn’t know she was the first. I couldn’t \\nlet her escape. \\n\\nI had to have a whore. That reefer was sending currents of anger and hatred \\nthrough me in time with “Indigo.” My mortal enemy squatted on that white \\nrug. \\n\\nI thought, “I’m going to murder this runt black bitch if she don’t give me \\nthat scratch she had in her bosom.” \\n\\nLike a brute cop giving a heist man a last chance to confess, I said, “Bitch, \\ngive me that scratch you had between your tiddies.” \\n\\nHer peepers ballooned in surprise and anger. \\n\\nShe gritted, “You’re pimping too hard skinny ass nigger. I have changed \\nmy mind. Get your lid and benny and split.” \\n\\nThe “Indigo” was on a torrid upbeat. Like brown-skin lightning I leaped \\nerect from the chaise. I flung my right leg back. \\n\\nI could feel the tendons at my hip socket straining. My eyes sighted for a \\nheart shot. My needle-toed eleven triple-A shoe rocketed toward her. \\n\\nThe lucky runt turned a fraction of a second in time. The leather bomb \\nexploded into her left shoulder blade. It knocked her flat on her belly. She lay \\nthere groaning. \\n\\nThen like in the dreams in the joint, I kicked her rear end until my leg \\ncramped. Through it all she just moaned and sobbed. I was soaked in sweat. \\nPanting, I lay on the bear-skin beside her. I thrust my mouth against her ear. \\n\\nIn an icy whisper I said, “Bitch, do I have to kill you to make you my \\nwhore? Get up and give me that scratch.” \\n\\nShe turned her head and looked into my eyes. There was no anger in them \\nnow, only fear and strange passion. Her tremulous mouth opened to speak. \\nFor a long moment nothing came out. \\n\\nThen she whispered, “You got a whore Blood. Please don’t kick me any \\nmore. I’m your little dog. I’ll do anything you say. I love you. Pretty Daddy.” \\n\\nHer talons stabbed into the back of my neck as she tried to suck my tongue \\nfrom its roots. I could taste her salty tears. \\n\\nShe wobbled to the record player. She lifted a corner of it. She slid that \\nwad of scratch from beneath it. She rejected “Indigo.” She put another platter \\n\\n\\n\\non the turntable. \\n\\n“Lady Day” was singing a sad lament. “My man don’t love me, treats me \\nawful mean. He’s the meanest man that I ever seen.” \\n\\nI was standing on the bear skin. She came toward me with the scratch in \\nher hand. She laid it in my palm. I riffled it in a fast count. It was respectable. \\nIt had to be over two bills. I was ready to let that cherry pop. \\n\\nI scooped the ninty-pound runt up into my arms. I bit her hard on the tip of \\nher chin. I carried her to the side of the bed. I hurled her onto it. She bounced \\nand lay there on her back. She was breathing hard. Her legs were a wide \\npyramid. \\n\\nI got out of my clothes fast. I snatched the top sheet off. I ripped it into \\nfour narrow strips. I tied her hands to the bed posts. I spread eagled her legs. \\nWith the longer strips, I tied her legs to the top of the springs at the sides of \\nthe bed. \\n\\nShe lay there a prisoner. I put her through the nerve shredding routines \\nPepper had taught me. She blacked out four times. She couldn’t pull back \\nfrom the thrilling, awful torture. \\n\\nFinally, I took a straight ride home. On the way I tried to smash the track. I \\nreached my destination. The blast of hate was big enough to spawn a million \\nembryo black pimps. \\n\\nI untied her. We lay there in the dim blueness. The fake white stars glowed \\ndown on us. “Lady Day” still moaned her troubles. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I want you to hump like Hell in these streets for a week. \\nWe’re going to the big track in the city. Oh yes, this week we got to get that \\ntitle to the Ford changed. I don’t drive no bitch’s wheels. It’s got to be in my \\nname, understand?” \\n\\nShe said, “Yes, Daddy, anything you say. Daddy, don’t get angry, but I \\nwas bullshitting about that C note trick.” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I knew that. Don’t ever try to con me again.” \\n\\nI got up and put my clothes on. I peeled a fin off the scratch and put it on \\nthe dresser. \\n\\nI said, “I want you in the street at six tonight. Stay out of the bars. Work \\nthe area around Seventh and Apple.” \\n\\n“I’ll come through sometime tonight. You be there when I show. If you get \\nbusted your name is Mary Jones. If you forget it I can’t raise you fast. Have \\nsome scratch whenever I show.” \\n\\nI went down to the street. I got into my Ford. It roared to life. I drove \\n\\n\\n\\ntoward Mama’s. I felt good. I wasn’t doing bad for a black boy just out of the \\njoint. \\n\\nI shuddered when I thought, what if I hadn’t kept my ears flapping back \\nthere in the joint? I would be a boot black or porter for the rest of my life in \\nthe high walled white world. My black whore was a cinch to get piles of \\nwhite scratch from that forbidden white world. \\n\\nMama was pressing a young customer’s hair. She saw me get out of the \\nFord in front of the shop. She called me inside with a waggle of the pressing \\ncomb. \\n\\nShe said, “I have been worried. Where have you been all night? Where did \\nyou get the pretty little car? Did you find a job?” \\n\\nI said, “A friend of mine let me borrow it. Maybe he’ll sell it to me. I \\nstayed with him all night. He’s got a hundred-and-three fever. I’ll try to find a \\njob tomorrow.” \\n\\nShe said, “There’s a roast in the oven. Shut the gas off and eat. I hope. Son, \\nyou haven’t been with Pepper.” \\n\\nI looked down at the nut brown, shapely girl getting her hair pressed. \\n\\nI said, “Pepper? She’s too old for me. I like young pretty brownskin girls. \\nPepper’s too yellow for me.” \\n\\nThe young broad flashed her eyes up at me. She smiled. I winked and ran \\nmy tongue over my lips. She dug it. She blushed. I put her on file. \\n\\nI turned and walked to the sidewalk. I went upstairs and attacked the roast. \\n\\nI took a long nap. At five-thirty p.m. I went down and got into the Ford. I \\ndrove to Seventh and Apple. I parked. \\n\\nAt five minutes to six I saw Phyllis coming toward me. She was a block \\naway. I fired the engine and pulled away. \\n\\nIt sure looked like I had copped a whore. I went back at midnight. She \\nlooked mussed up and tired. She got into the car. \\n\\nI said, “Well, how goes it Baby?” \\n\\nShe dug in her bosom and handed me a damp wad of bills. I counted it. It \\nwas a fin over half a C. \\n\\nShe said, “I’m tired and nasty, and my shoulder and ass ache. Can I stop \\nnow, Daddy? I would like a pastrami and coffee and a bath. You know how \\nyou kicked me last night” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, the track closes at two. I’ll take you to the sandwich and \\ncoffee. The bath will have to wait until the two o’clock breakdown. You \\nneeded your ass kicked.” \\n\\n\\n\\nShe sighed and said, “All right Daddy, anything you say.” \\n\\nI drove her to an open-air kosher joint. She kept squirming on the hard \\nwooden bench. Her butt must have been giving her fits. She was silent until \\nshe finished the sandwich and coffee. \\n\\nThen she said, “Daddy, please don’t misunderstand me. I like a little \\nslapping around before my man does it to me. Please don’t be as cruel as you \\nwere last night. You might kill me.” \\n\\nI said, “Baby, never horse around with my scratch or try to play con on me. \\nYou blew my stack last night. You don’t have to worry so long as you never \\nviolate my rules. I will never hurt you more than to turn you on.” \\n\\nI drove her back to the track. She got out of the car. As soon as she hit the \\nsidewalk, two white tricks almost had a wreck pulling to the curb for her. She \\nwas a black money-tree all right. \\n\\nThe next day I took her to a notary. In ten minutes we walked out. She \\ngave me the three bills back that I had paid her for the Ford. \\n\\nIt was legal now. She wasn’t beefing. Her bruises were healing and she \\nwas ripe for another “prisoner of love” scene. She finished the week in great \\nhumping style. I had a seven-bill bankroll. \\n\\nSunday evening I packed the runt’s bearskin and other things into the trunk \\nof the Ford. \\n\\nI parked around the corner from Mama’s. I went up to get my things \\ntogether. Mama caught me packing. Tears flooded her eyes. She grabbed me \\nand held me tightly against her. Her sobbing was strangling her. \\n\\nShe sobbed, “Son, don’t you love your Mama anymore? Where are you \\ngoing? Why do you want to leave the nice home I fixed for you? I just know \\nif you leave I’ll never see you again. We don’t have anybody but each other. \\nPlease don’t leave me. Don’t break my heart, Son.” \\n\\nI heard her words. I was too far gone for her grief to register. I kept \\nthinking about that freak, black money-tree in the Ford. I was eager to get to \\nthat fast pimp track in the city. \\n\\nI said, “Mama, you know I love you. I got a fine clerk’s job in a men’s \\nstore in the city. Everybody in this town knows I’m an excon. I have to leave. \\nI love you for making a home for me. You have been an angel to stick by me \\nthrough those prison bits. You’ll see me again. I’ll be back to visit you. \\nHonest, Mama, I will.” \\n\\nI had to wrestle out of her arms. I picked up my bags and hit the stairs. \\nWhen I reached the sidewalk, I looked up at the front window. Mama was \\n\\n\\n\\ngnawing her knuckles and crying her heart out. My shirt front was wet with \\nher tears. \\n\\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\nTHE JUNGLE FAUNA \\n\\n\\nThe yellow Ford ran like an escaped con. We got to Chicago in two hours. \\nWe checked into a hotel in a slum neighborhood, around 29th and State \\nStreets. We took our stuff out of the Ford’s trunk. \\n\\nIt was ten p.m. I threw some water on my face. I told the runt to cool it. I \\nwent out and cruised around to case the city. \\n\\nI turned the wipers on. A late March snowfall was starting. About a mile \\nfrom the hotel I saw whores working the streets. \\n\\nI parked and went into a bar in the heart of the action. It stank like a son- \\nof-a-bitch. It was a junkie joint. I sat sipping on a bottle of suds; I couldn’t \\ntrust the glasses. \\n\\nA cannon with a tired horse face took the vacant stool in my right. His stall \\ntook the one on the left. The stall had a yellow fox face. Out of the corner of \\nmy eye I saw him pinning me. He snapped his fingers. I jerked my head \\ntoward him. \\n\\nHe said, “Brother, you are lucky as a shit-house rat. What size benny and \\nvine you wear? I’m Dress ’em up Red. Stand up brother so I can dig your \\nsize. I got a pile of crazy vines dirt cheap.” \\n\\nI stood up facing him. He ran his eyes up and down me. He unbuttoned my \\ntop coat. He pulled my vine’s lapels. He shoved me back toward Horseface. I \\nstumbled, half turned to apologize to Horseface. There was a streaking blur \\nbehind me. It was so fast I couldn’t have sworn I had seen it. I found out later \\nwhat it had been. \\n\\nHorseface showed his choppers, got off the stool and trotted through the \\nslammer. I faced the stall. \\n\\nI said, “Jim, you got my size? Do you have any black mohairs?” \\n\\nThe stall smiled crookedly at me. He straightened my tie. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe said, “Slim, I got blue and black mohair, I can fit you like Saville Row \\nin London. You want the blue too? The bite is two for fifty slats.” \\n\\nI said, “Man, let’s go. I am ready to cop.” \\n\\nHis brow telescoped like I was going to open a door and catch his mother \\ncrapping in my hat. He started oozing toward the slammer. \\n\\nHe said, “Brother, I don’t know you well enough to trust you. I got to \\nprotect my stash. Wouldn’t it be a bitch if you went with me and copped? \\nWhat if you came back later and beat me?” \\n\\n“No, Slim, cool it. I’ll be back in twenty minutes with the vines. Here’s a \\nslat. Get a taste on Dress ’em up Red.” \\n\\nI ordered another beer. I was trying to stall that twenty minutes out. I sure \\nneeded those vines. \\n\\nAfter an hour I figured Dress ’em up Red got busted or something. \\n\\nI asked the fat broad tending bar where the swank joints were. She named a \\nfew, and gave me directions. My bill was eighty cents. I left a twenty-cent tip \\nand walked to the Ford. \\n\\nThe wind wing on the street side gaped open. It had been jimmied. The car \\ndoor had been unlocked through it. \\n\\nI got in. I remembered the runt’s costume jewelry had been locked in the \\nglove compartment. I unlocked it. Some slick bastard had slit the cardboard \\nbottom from underneath. There wasn’t even an earring left. \\n\\nI started the motor and turned the lights on. The snow had stopped falling. \\nMy headlights beamed on a squatting junkie whore with a Dracula face \\npeeing in the gutter. She grinned toothlessly into the glare like maybe she \\nwas a starlet taking bows at a movie premiere. \\n\\nI thundered the motor. She stood up wide legged. Her cat was a mangy red \\nslash. She was holding up the bottom front of her dress with her rusty elbows. \\nHer long black fingers were pulling her snare wide open to stop me. \\n\\nAs I shot by her, she shouted, “Come back here Nigger! It ain’t but a \\nbuck.” \\n\\nI drove through the snow-slushed streets. The streetlights were dim halos \\nin the murk. \\n\\nI thought, “I can’t put the runt down in a spot like back there. I have to find \\nsomebody to give me a rundown.” \\n\\nI drove a hundred blocks. Suddenly a huge red neon sign glittered through \\nthe gloom. It read “Devil’s Roost.” It was one of the joints the fat broad at the \\nhype bar had told me about. \\n\\n\\n\\nGaudy Hogs and Lincolns were bumper to bumper. They pigged the \\nparking spaces on the Roost’s side of the street. I parked across the street. I \\ngot out of the Ford and crossed the street. \\n\\nI started walking down the sidewalk toward the Roost. “The Bird,” \\nEckstein and Sarah sent a crazy medley of soul sounds from the rib and \\nchicken joint’s loudspeakers. The street was as busy as a black anthill. Studs \\nand broads in sharp clothes paraded the block. \\n\\nThe hickory-smoked chicken and rib odors watered my mouth. I was at the \\npoint of stepping into one for a fast feast. The sign said “Creole Fat’s Rib \\nHeaven.” I didn’t make it. \\n\\nA long, stooped shadow stood in my way. He was chanting at me like a \\nvoodoo doctor. He pointed toward a storefront. Its window was blacked out \\nwith blue paint. \\n\\nHe sang, “Shootin’ ’em up inside, heavy and good. Scratch piled up like \\ncords of wood. Geez you look lucky, Jack. Seven, eleven point right back. \\nThat’s sure you. Jack. Go in fast. Come out quicker. Lady Luck is a bitch but \\nyou can stick her.” \\n\\nHis topcoat was a threadbare green-checked antique. The tops of his \\nshabby black shoes had criss-cross holes snipped out. His bulging corns were \\nhumps pressing through the vents. He stank like a bootlegger’s garbage. \\nThere was something ghostly familiar in the banana yellow, Basset-Hound \\nface. \\n\\nI said, “Jim, I’m not in the mood to whale the craps. Say, don’t I know \\nyou?” \\n\\nHis transient eyes jerked their bags. They moved over my shoulder, \\nsearching down the sidewalk for a fresh prospect. His bald head glistened like \\na tiny yellow lake under the street lamp. \\n\\nHe said, “Jack, I can’t put a pistol on you. I can’t force you to go inside \\nand collect your scratch. Kid, you too young to know me. You might a heard \\nof me. I’m Pretty Preston. I gave the whores blues in the night when I was \\npimping at my peak. Who are you?” \\n\\nHis name triggered my clear memory of him. He had driven a gleaming \\nblack La Salle car. I had shined his shoes back in the pressing shop days. \\n\\nThen he had been sleek and handsome like a yellow Valentino. I \\nremembered his diamonds. They had winked and sparkled brightly on his \\nfingers, in his shirt cuffs, even on his shirt front. \\n\\nI thought, “Could this really be the same dandy? What had happened to \\n\\n\\n\\nhim?” \\n\\nI said, “Preston, I know you. I’m the kid who used to shine your Stacy’s \\nback on Main Street. Remember me? I’m pimping myself now. You sure \\npimped up a storm when I was a kid. What happened? Why are you steering \\nfor this craps joint?” \\n\\nHe had a dreamy, far-away look in his dull brown eyes. He was probably \\nremembering his long ago flashy pimp days. He sighed and put his arms \\naround my shoulders. I walked with him through the door of the craps trap. \\n\\nThe raw stink of gamblers’ sweat punched up into my nose. We sat on a \\nbattered sofa in the almost dark front of the joint. Through a partition I could \\nhear the tinkle of silver coins. I heard the flat cackle of the bone dice laughing \\nat the cursing shooters begging for a natural. \\n\\nHe said, “Sure, Kid, I remember you. Christ, you got tall. I gotta be getting \\nold. What’s your name? Kid, I been getting funky breaks since I came to this \\nraggedy city twelve years ago. I’m just steering for a pal who runs the joint. \\n\\n“Hell he needs me more than I need him. I’m gonna catch a hot number, or \\na wild daily double. Old Preston’s name will ring again. How many girls you \\ngot?” \\n\\nI said, “Slim Lancaster, but they call me Young Blood. Blood for short. I \\nonly got one now, but with all the whores here I’ll have bookoos in a month. \\nI just got in town tonight. I want to put my girl to work. Give me a rundown \\non some streets after I dash next door for a slab of ribs. I haven’t dirtied a \\nplate since noon. Anything I can get you?” \\n\\nHe said, “Blood, if you must do something, get me a half-pint of Old \\nTaylor at the corner liquor store. I’ll rundown for you, but you ain’t going to \\nlike my tail-end rundown at all.” \\n\\nIt felt good to step out into the fresh, chilly air. I stopped in the rib joint \\nand put my order in. I saw the front of the Roost on my way to the corner. \\n\\nI tiptoed and peeked through the bottom of the window blind. The joint \\nwas jumping. Pimps, whores, and white men crowded the circular bar. \\n\\nSome skinny joker with scald burns on his face was fronting a combo. He \\ntried to ape the Birds phrasing and tone. His tan face had turned black. He \\nwas choking on his horn. \\n\\nMixed couples danced to “Stomping at the Savoy” on a carpetsized dance \\nfloor in the rear. Silk broads itching for forbidden fruit sat in booths lining the \\nwalls. \\n\\nTheir faces glowed starkly in the red dimness. Their long hair flopped \\n\\n\\n\\naround their shoulders as they threw their heads back. They laughed \\ndrunkenly with their black lovers. \\n\\nI took my peepers out of the slot. I walked toward the corner to cop the \\nbottle for Preston. I made a skull note to pop into the Roost after Preston’s \\nrundown. \\n\\nI was fifty feet from the corner when I saw him. He was in the center of a \\nsmall crowd. His high crown white hat was bobbing a foot above it. He was a \\nnut brown giant. \\n\\nAs I drew closer I could see his snow white teeth. His heavy lips were \\ndrawn back in a snarl. His wide shoulders jiggled. He was stomping on \\nsomething. It was like maybe he was a sharply togged fire dancer or maybe a \\ndapper grape crusher from Sicily. \\n\\nI squeezed through the crowd for a ringside view. He was grunting. His \\nlabor was yanking the sweat out of him. The crowd stood tittering and \\nexcited like a Salem mob watching the execution of a witch. \\n\\nThe witch was black. She had the slant eyes and doll features of a Geisha \\ngirl. \\n\\nThe chill breeze whipped back the bottom of his benny. The giant’s thigh \\nmuscles rippled inside the pants leg of his two-hundred-dollar vine. \\n\\nAgain and again he slammed his size-thirteen shoe down on the witch’s \\nbelly and chest. She was out cold. Her jaw hinge was awry and red frothy \\nbubbles bunched at the corners of her crooked mouth. \\n\\nAt last he scooped her from the pavement. She looked like an infant in his \\narms. His eyes were strangely damp. He wedged through the crowd to a \\npurple Hog at the curb. He looked down into her unconscious face. \\n\\nHe muttered, “Baby, why, why do you make me do you like this? Why \\ndon’t you hump and stop lushing and bullshitting with the tricks?” \\n\\nStill holding her tenderly, he stooped and opened the front door of the Hog. \\nHe placed her on the front seat. He shut the door and walked around the Hog \\nto the driver’s side. He got in and the Hog roared away into the night. \\n\\nThe crowd was scattering. I turned to a fellow about my age. His eyes were \\nglazed. He was sucking a stick of gangster. \\n\\nI said, “That stud would have gotten busted sure as Hell if the heat had \\nmade the scene.” \\n\\nHe stepped back and looked at me like I was fresh in town from a \\nmonastery in Tibet. \\n\\nHe said, “You must be that square, Rip Van Winkle, I heard about. He’s \\n\\n\\n\\nheat. He’s vice heat. They call him Poison. He’s got nine whores. He’s a \\npimp. That broad is one of ’em. She got drunk with a trick.” \\n\\nI went into the liquor store. It was five-after-twelve. I ordered the half pint. \\nThe clerk put it on the counter. I swung my topcoat away to get my hide in \\nmy hip pocket. I had two hundred in fives and tens in it. I had five C notes \\npinned to my shorts in a tobacco sack between my legs. \\n\\nMy fingers touched the bottom of the pocket. My right hip pocket was \\nempty. I was sure my hide had been on that side. I dug my left hand into the \\nleft pocket. Empty! \\n\\nWithin seconds both my sweaty hands had darted in and explored all my \\npockets a half-dozen times. The clerk just stood there amused watching the \\nshow. His hairy paw slid the half pint back toward him away from foul \\nterritory. \\n\\nHe said, “Whatsa matter. Buddy, some broad ram it into you for your poke \\nor did you leave it in your other Strides?” \\n\\nMy mind was ferreting. It back pedaled, tore apart the scenes and moves I \\nhad made. I was a confused, jazzy punk. \\n\\nI said, “Jack, your score is zero. I’m not a vie. I just remembered I got my \\nscratch on Mars. I’ll be back when I get back.” \\n\\nHe was shaking his head when I walked out. I crossed the street. I was \\nheaded toward the Ford. I wasn’t going there to look for my hide on the seat. \\nI was going there to peel off one of those C notes next to my balls. \\n\\nI had remembered the scene back in the hype joint. I saw that rattlesnake \\nlightning again. For the first time I saw the thrill of the cop on the face of the \\nhorse. The Fox had sure held my balls in the fire for Horseface. \\n\\nI thought, “As slick as those two bastards are they can’t miss making a \\nmillion or getting croaked.” \\n\\nFrom that day to this one almost thirty years later no scratch has ever been \\nin my hide. \\n\\nI copped the bottle. I was hurrying to pick up my rib order. Old Preston \\nwas back out there bird-dogging suckers. I saw him point a joker into the \\njoint. He slapped the balking sucker on the rump. The vie went inside. He \\nsaw me and hobbled toward me. For the first time I saw his crippled walk. He \\ngrinned when I laid the bottle on him. He said, “Thanks Kid, want first \\nsuck?” I said, “Jack, it’s all yours. After I get my ribs I’ll duck back in the \\njoint and rap with you.” \\n\\nPreston had his bad dogs propped on a chair when I got back. I stumbled \\n\\n\\n\\nover his make-shift sandals beside the sofa. I sat down. His feet stank like a \\nterminal cancer victim. Even a budding pimp has to have a cast iron belly. I \\nunwrapped and started to gobble the ribs. \\n\\nHe said, “I guess you saw pimping Poison hanging that whore on the \\ncorner. He’s number two mack man in town.” \\n\\nThrough the peppery grease I burbled, “Yeh, she looked dead to me. I \\nguess he checked her into the morgue. How does he cut the double action? \\nWho, as strong as he is, could top him?” \\n\\nHe tilted the bottle straight up and drained it. He said, “She ain’t croaked. \\nShe’ll be back out before daylight humping her ass off. He’s the top Nigger \\nvice roller in town. His pimping don’t faze the white brass just so he don’t \\nkick no white asses. Poison is a nice sweet stud compared to Sweet Jones. \\nSweet’s the top spade pimp in the country.” \\n\\nI said, “Preston, I want to be great like Sweet. I want my name to ring like \\nhis. I want to be slick enough to handle a hundred whores. Can you pull my \\ncoat so I can cut into Sweet and get down right and really do the thing.” \\n\\nIn the half darkness I saw his yellow jaw pop loose. His hound face was \\ntwisting sideways in quizzical amazement. His face jig-sawed like maybe I \\nhad asked him to let me knock him up. He starched like a corpse on the sofa. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, you bang a cap of smack or something? Sweet’s crazy as a \\nflock of loons. Your bell ain’t never gonna clang that loud, unless you go \\ncrazy too. He’s killed four studs. He ain’t human. He’s got every Nigger in \\ntown scared shitless. His whores call him Mr. Jones. \\n\\n“He hates young punks. I can’t cut you into him. Kid, I like you. You’re \\ngood looking. You conned me that you’re intelligent. I am going to give you \\nsome advice. Take it or leave it. \\n\\n“I came to this town twelve years ago. I was so pretty just my ass would \\nhave made you a Sunday face. I brought five whores with me. I had been one \\nhell of a pimp back in the sticks. I was only twentyeight when I got here. \\n\\n“Just like you, I had to cut into Sweet. It was easy for me. I was yellow and \\npretty. I also had three beautiful white whores in my stable. I didn’t know \\nSweet hated yellow Niggers and white men. \\n\\n“He grinned that gold-toothed smile for a year. He conned me that he \\nloved me. He was a hype even then. He started to rib me, called me a square. \\nI tried hard to be like him, so I got hooked on H. \\n\\n“My habit screwed my mind up. All I wanted to do was bang H and coast. \\nLike a real pal he kept my stable humping. At first his angle was Uncle Sweet \\n\\n\\n\\nto my whores. In six weeks he was giving me and my whores orders. He tore \\nmy image down before my whores. He copped my stable. \\n\\n“One morning, I was puking sick. Sweet was torturing me. He hadn’t \\nbrought me my stuff in twenty-four hours. I was cold as ice wrapped in a \\nblanket, then red hot. I was naked, crawling on the floor, nailing my body \\nbloody when he came in. He stood over me flashing that gold in his jib. \\n\\n“Sweet said, ‘Easy now you pretty yellow bastard. There’s been a panic. \\nUntil this morning I couldn’t cop any stuff. I copped you a sixteenth in Spic \\ntown. You know I gotta love your stinking junkie ass to stick my neck out \\nlike that. Ain’t that a bitch. I just noticed when you sick you almost black as \\nme. \\n\\n“T wish that bastard white father of your’s could see you down there on \\nyour knees begging this black Nigger to stop your misery.’ \\n\\n“Sweet held the tiny cellophane pack out to me. I was too weak to take it. \\n\\n“I said, ‘Please Sweet, cook it for me and load my outfit. It’s inside the \\ncandy-striped tie in the closet. Sweet if you don’t hurry, I’m sure to croak.’ \\n\\n“I was one big ache and cramp. He walked slowly to the closet. He \\nfumbled past the striped tie on the rack. He was getting his kicks making the \\nyellow Nigger suffer. \\n\\n“I screamed, ‘Sweet you had your mitt on the right one. It’s there! Right \\nthere!’ \\n\\n“Sweet finally got the spike out of the tie lining. I was too weak to shoot \\nthe H when he got it cooked. I held my arm flat on the carpet. My eyes \\nbegged him to tie me up and bang me. \\n\\n“He pulled my belt from my trousers on a chair. He tightened the belt \\naround my arm above the elbow. My veins stood out like blue rope. He \\nstabbed the needle into a vein in the hollow. The glass tube turned red. I lay \\nthere freezing to death waiting for the smack to slug the sickness and pain out \\nof me.” \\n\\nPreston stopped for breath. Bubbles of sweat had popped out on his bald \\nhead. While running down Sweet’s double cross, he had really relived it. \\n\\nI licked the hot sauce off my hands. I crushed the greasy sack into a ball \\nand sailed it into a paper box at my end of the sofa. I fished my handkerchief \\nout and wiped my mouth and hands. \\n\\nThose dice the house was using had a Ph.D. Every ten minutes a chump \\nwould shuffle from the rear with a tapped out look on his face. \\n\\nI said, “Christ, Sweet’s slick and cold blooded. What happened after that?” \\n\\n\\n\\nPreston said, “That shot took the fever and pain away. I wasn’t ready to go \\na fast fifteen with Joe Louis. I felt better. Sweet stood in the middle of the \\nfloor watching me. My legs were weak when I finally stood up. I stood there \\nnaked. \\n\\n“I said, ‘Sweet, I know you have stolen my stable. I know I have been a \\nprize sucker, I demand that you lay a grand or so on me. I got to kick this \\nhabit you conned me into. I won’t give you any headaches. You got to loan \\nme that G.’ \\n\\n“Sweet just stood there like a black Buddha for a long moment. For a \\nsecond I thought he was going to put his foot in my ass like I was a whore. \\nHe grinned. He pulled my robe from the foot of the bed. He draped it around \\nmy shoulders. \\n\\n“Then he said, ‘Sweetheart, I ain’t stole no whores from you. Them whores \\nwould have blew to the wind if it don’t be for me. You got me. I’m just like \\nyour whore. Wouldn’t you rather I had them whores than some bastard you \\ncouldn’t cop a favor from? Course I’m going to give you the grand. I’m even \\ngoing to give you back that buck-toothed yellow whore you had. I want you \\nto straighten up. Sweetheart, I love you.’ \\n\\n“I said. Sweet when do I get the grand? I got to know it’s coming at a \\ncertain time.’ \\n\\n“Sweet said, ‘Look Sweetheart, you get it no later than tomorrow morning. \\nI’ll bring the buck-toothed bitch with me. Today before noon I’ll send you a \\nquarter piece. You got no reason to sweat. Sweet’s in your corner. \\nSweetheart.’ \\n\\n“He chucked me under the chin and walked out. The runner came with the \\nquarter piece at eleven o’clock, I was beginning to think Sweet was only half \\nrat. \\n\\n“At noon two rollers broke the door down. I was coasting. I was draped in \\nmy P.J.’s. They found the H and booked me for possession. I got a fin. I \\nkicked the habit cold turkey in city jail. I did three years, nine months in the \\nstate joint. \\n\\n“I left my hair, teeth, and looks in the joint. A con ran a shiv into my \\nplumbing. That’s why I limp and pee out of this tube in my side. I ain’t had a \\nwhore since.” \\n\\nPreston had choked up. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, you still want to try this track and cut into Sweet?” \\n\\nI turned my face from him. He was mopping his tears away with his \\n\\n\\n\\nsleeve. I was sure a lost, stupid punk. After a rundown like that, I was still \\nitching to take my crack at the fast track. \\n\\nThe rundown had only boosted my desire to meet the slick, icy Sweet. If I \\nhad been smart I would have jumped in that Ford and rushed back to the \\nsticks. \\n\\nI thought, “Sweet hates yellow and white. I am black like him. The runt is \\nblack. Sweet won’t have a black whore. I have no reason to fear him. I have \\nnothing that he wants. I have to find him and pick his brain. I got to take that \\nshort cut to become a great pimp.” \\n\\nI said, “To hell with the Sweet cut-in. I’m not bats, but I got to try this \\ntrack. Yeh, Preston, you sure got the hurt put to you. Man, I feel for you. \\nWhen I start pimping a zillion, I’ll do something big for you. You are \\noverdue for a break. Now tell me the best spot to down my package.” \\n\\nHe said, “You gotta get your head bumped, huh? What kind of package \\nyou got?” \\n\\nI said, “Black, eighteen, cute, stacked, and three way.” \\n\\nHe said, “Blood, we are sitting on the best street in town for a package like \\nthat. Only drawback is this street is crawling with fast, whore-hungry pimps. \\n\\n“You would also be playing your girl against a half-dozen strong, jasper \\nwhores on this stem. They pimping tough as studs. \\n\\n“They got some fancy con to lay on a fine young whore. If your game ain’t \\ntight, you’ll blow your girl fast. How long you had her? What kind of wheels \\nyou got?” \\n\\nI said, “About a week, but I got her up tight. The Bitch loves me. Nobody \\ncan steal her. Temporarily I got a Ford.” \\n\\nHe threw his head back and started laughing. I thought he had flipped his \\ncork. He died laughing for a full minute. The tears were rolling down his \\ncheeks when he stopped. \\n\\nHe said, “Blood Lancaster, Slim Young, Dizzy Willie, or whatever your \\nname is, don’t get down in this town if you ain’t hip that a pimp don’t never \\nhave a whore tight. Do you believe any whore can love a pimp? \\n\\n“You ain’t no pimp. These slick Niggers will steal that young bitch as soon \\nas you down her. The bartenders and bell hops on this fast track are better \\npimps than the best in the hinterlands. \\n\\n“You ain’t got no front and flash. Some of these bootblacks got Hogs. \\nYou’ll get that young bitch dazzled out from under you. Get out of town and \\nbe a good pimp in a chump town. Go to the West Coast. Believe me, you \\n\\n\\n\\nain’t ready for this one.” \\n\\nHe stopped rapping. He sat there just looking at me like I should bolt out \\nthe door and head for suckerville. He sure thought he had spooked me. His \\nribbing had me hot as a Bull Run musket. \\n\\nI thought, “What did this crippled flunky think I came here for? I knew I \\nwas slow. I sure didn’t intend to stay slow. I was determined to maybe get as \\nfast and slick as Sweet Jones, the boss pimp. If I blew the runt it wouldn’t be \\nthe end of the world. This poor cry baby had let Sweets cross destroy him.” \\n\\nI said, “Look Preston, I got lots of heart. I’m not a pussy. I been to the joint \\ntwice. I did tough bits, but I didn’t fall apart. I believe my whore loves me in \\nher freak way. I believe I got her. \\n\\n“If I’m wrong, and I blow her, so what. I won’t give up no matter what \\nhappens. If I go stone blind. I’m still going to pimp. If my props get cut off \\nI’ll wheel myself on a wagon looking for a whore. I’m going to pimp or die. \\n\\n“I’m not going to be a flunky in this white man’s world. You can’t \\nconvince me I can’t pimp here. I know I can get my share of pussys to \\npeddle. I’m going to get hip to what I don’t know. I’m not afraid of Sweet. \\nI’m going to cut into him and pick his brain like a buzzard.” \\n\\nA heavy-set Greek with a carny face came in the door. I dummied up. He \\nwalked by us then went through the small door in the partition. Preston \\nstarted to put his shoes on. He looked nervous. \\n\\nI asked, “Who’s the big stud? Is he heat?” \\n\\nHe said, “Oh, he’s the owner of the joint come to check the bankroll and \\ncut box.” \\n\\n“Then you and your pal are flunkies for the Greek?” \\n\\nBefore he could answer the Greek came out. Preston was slipping into his \\ntopcoat. The Greek paused and glared at him. \\n\\nHe said, “I ain’t payin you a fin a night to sit on your keister. I can get a \\nhundred boys to jump for that fin and the cot in the back. Your ass will grow \\nicicles in the alleys if you don’t get on the ball. Get out on the midway and \\ndump some suckers into the joint.” \\n\\nPreston said, “Yes, Sir, Mr. Nick, but I wasn’t setting there but a minute \\nbefore you showed. You know nobody can pull a mark better than me.” \\n\\nI avoided Preston’s eyes when we got on the sidewalk. I knew what I’d see \\nthere. I felt sorry for him. I pulled a sawbuck from my pocket. I folded it and \\ndropped it into his ragged coat pocket. He took it out and put it in his short \\npocket. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe said, “Thanks Blood, maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe you got \\nthe guts for the fast track. You’ll need all you got. Good luck, Kid.” \\n\\nI said, “Preston, thanks for the rundown. In six months you’ll have to \\nanchor your eyeballs. I’m getting down right on this stem tomorrow night. \\nYou can’t stop a stepper. Don’t worry if the Greek boots you out. I’ll cop you \\na pad.” \\n\\nI peeped into my skull file and saw that Roost note. My Mickey Mouse \\nread one-thirty a.m. I headed toward the Roost. I had been in town only three- \\nand-a-half hours. It had cost me only two-hundred and twelve slats to find out \\nhow little I knew. It’s easy for a half-wise punk to lock his mind. Just this \\nwas worth a fortune. \\n\\nI thought, “I have to keep my mind like a sponge. I’ll use my eyes and ears \\nlike suction cups. I have to know everything about crosses and whores. \\n\\n“Fast, I got to find out the secrets of pimping. I don’t want to be a half-ass \\ngigolo lover like the white pimps. I really want to control the whole whore. I \\nwant to be the boss of her life, even her thoughts. I got to con them that \\nLincoln never freed the slaves.” \\n\\nThe Roost was still jumping. I copped the one open stool at the middle of \\nthe bar. A Mexican broad in a red satin cocktail dress brought me a pink \\nPlanters Punch. \\n\\nThe combo was speed riffing “Tea For Two.” Through the barlength \\nmirror I could see a black ugly stud playing stink finger with an angel-faced \\nwhite broad in a booth behind me. He was playing pocket pool with his other \\nhand. The broad had her eyes closed. Her rhinestone tiara looked like a phony \\nhalo. She was biting her bottom lip like maybe she was taking a heavenly trip \\nright there in the booth. \\n\\nMy ear cups started sucking. The dapper joker on my right was rapping to \\nthe stud on the other side of him. \\n\\nHe was saying, “I want my three bills back. That pretty bitch ain’t turned \\nthree tricks since you sold her to me. The bitch is dying. She’s falling apart. \\nShe can’t walk the street.” \\n\\nThe seller said, “Jack, I sold you the package as is. I ain’t responsible for \\ndivine acts.” \\n\\nThe buyer said, “Divine my ass. You knew that dog was rotten inside and \\nneeded a grand’s worth of carving. Give me a yard and a half and take the \\nbitch back.” \\n\\nThe seller said, “You a stick up man? The bitch was whole when I sold \\n\\n\\n\\nher. Maybe you trying to play con on me. Maybe you stomped on the \\npackage. Maybe you put the bitch in bad shape. I ain’t buying her back even \\nif you only wanted a slat for her.” \\n\\nThe buyer said, “Ain’t this a bitch? I went for the okee doke. I’m out three \\nbills for a black dog with a foot in the grave.” \\n\\nThe seller said, “I’m pimping for myself. Jack. I ain’t got no time to pimp \\nfor you. Just to get you off my ass. I’m going to rundown for you. \\n\\n“There’s a whore house up state with all Spic trade. They don’t spend but a \\nfin, but there’s a zillion of ’em. On weekends they line up on the sidewalk. \\n\\n“All you gotta do is cop some pills. Patch the bitch up and take her up \\nthere. Up there, ain’t no walking. She can flat back and so long as she keeps \\nbreathing you can get some scratch. Jack, she may even last long enough so \\nyou can invest the scratch to overhaul her, and still show a profit. \\n\\n“The bitch is black and pretty. She ain’t got much mileage on her. Them \\nSpies are wild for black broads. Jim, I been running down the out for you. If \\nyou go for it call me at noon. \\n\\n“In the meantime I’ll contact the joint. Me and the house broad are tight. \\nIt’s a cinch you can place your grief tomorrow.” \\n\\nThe buyer said, “Jack, you know I deserve some cooperation. I’ll try \\nanything to break even on that dog. I’ll call you at noon. I ain’t salty with you \\nnow. Let’s split and make the scene at the lair. I’ll pop for a coupla rounds.” \\n\\nThe buyer stood up. He knocked his knuckles against the log. The cute \\nMexican broad came toward him to check him out. She stood before him. She \\nwas smiling. \\n\\nThe seller drained his glass and stood. He leaned across the log staring into \\nher bosom. I was digging the action from that trap door in the corner of my \\neye. \\n\\nShe said, “Both tabs come to twelve dollars. Yours is seven. Your friend’s \\nis five.” \\n\\nThe buyer said, “I’ve got ’em both. Here’s a double saw. Keep the change \\nMiss Bet I Get You. Say Girl, was that bum your father who brought you in \\nwhen you started to work here last night? Ain’t you afraid I’ll salt and pepper \\nyou and eat you raw?” \\n\\nShe said, “No, not my father, my husband. He’s no bum. He had on his \\nwork clothes. People are not good to eat. It’s not nice to eat people. Thanks \\nfor the tip. Come back soon.” \\n\\nThe buyer hurled his beak toward the ceiling and laughed. Flakes of \\n\\n\\n\\ngrayish white dust clung to the hairs in his nostrils. He had snorted and \\nloaded his skull with H. \\n\\nHer mouth was still smiling. Her big black eyes had slitted in Latin fury. \\nShe turned away toward the register. She punched it. She came back. She \\nstood staring at the buyer. She had a fin and three slats in her hand. She was \\ncrushing them into a missile. In the mirror I saw the seller shaking his head as \\nhe walked out the door. \\n\\nThe buyer was looking at her like the eight slats had made her his \\nindentured slave. The four-carat stone on his left hand flashed like neon as he \\ncaressed his fly. \\n\\nHe said, “If that tramp was your man I’m stealing you. Shit, I should \\nkidnap you right now. You ain’t got no business juggling suds. Bitch, you got \\na mint between your big hairy legs. I’m gonna show you how to make a \\ngrand a week. I ain’t never wanted nothing and didn’t get it. Bitch, I’m gonna \\nget you. I’ll be back at four to pick you up.” \\n\\nA massive black bulk with a face like a rabid bulldog had come on the \\nscene. It had to be the joint bouncer. He was standing several feet behind the \\nbuyer, grinning like a starved croc. He was hunching his shoulders. The \\nMexican broad was shaking. She fired the missile. It struck the buyer on the \\ntip of his beak. He threw his hands across his face. \\n\\nShe shouted, “You stupid ugly filth. You insane Nigger bastard. Do you \\nthink I’d let you touch me? I wouldn’t shit in your mouth to save your slimy \\nlife. If you ever look at me again I’ll cut your heart out!” \\n\\nThe bouncer streaked toward the buyer like a howitzer shell. His feet \\nclickety-clacked like the wheels of an express train against the parquet floor. \\nHe vised the buyer’s rear end through the tail split in his topcoat. \\n\\nHe seized the scrawny neck with his other giant paw. The buyer was \\nalmost airborne. The tips of his shoes did a tap dance against the floor on his \\nway to the door. The joint was silent. The buyer swiveled his head back \\ntoward the angry tamale. \\n\\nJust before he skidded toward the sidewalk he screamed, “You square-ass \\ngreasy chili-gut bitch. I’m gonna triple-cross you.” \\n\\nThe joint got back on jump time. The combo started to riff “Mood Indigo.” \\n\\nI thought about the runt. The Mexican broad had her hands on her hips. \\nShe was looking at me. She wanted me to say the buyer was a nogood \\nbastard. She didn’t know I was up as a pledge in his club. \\n\\nI put a deuce on the log and walked out. It was two-thirty in the a.m. I \\n\\n\\n\\nwalked to the corner. Preston had been right. Poison’s black whore was \\nstanding in front of the liquor store. She hit on me. That terrible beating she \\nhad taken sure hadn’t cured her bad habit. \\n\\nShe said, “Hi Slim, give me ten and sock it in. I won’t put the rush on you \\nhandsome. Cop a jug and let’s go freak off.” \\n\\nI jerked my head away from the sight of her like she was Medusa. I put my \\ndogs in high gear and crossed the street. I had a quick vision of Poison’s \\nthirteens giving me a butt ache. \\n\\nI got into the Ford and made a U-turn. I was going to the runt and some \\ndoss. I caught Preston in my headlights on the turn. He was still out there \\ntrying to make the Greek richer. He waved. I honked. \\n\\nThe mercury had fallen. The icy streets were like a ski run. \\n\\nLess than a mile from the Roost, I saw a clean front of a hotel. The blue \\nneon sparkled out “Blue Haven Hotel.” I went into the blue-and-red lobby. A \\nbroad was on the desk. She had a razor slash on her tan cheek. She had the \\nbuild and rapper of a heavyweight wrestler. \\n\\nShe said, “You want something permanent or just for the night?” \\n\\nI said, “How much are the permanent pads? I want the best you got. \\nWhatever it is, it’s got to be on the front with a view.” \\n\\nShe said, “The best single rooms are thirty-two-fifty a week. The best \\nthree-room apartments are a hundred a week.” \\n\\nShe got up and went to a red board behind her. She took several keys off \\nand gave them to me. \\n\\nThe elevator operator was an old stud reading a wild Maggie and Jiggs \\ncomic book. He was whistling “When the Saints go Marching In.” His \\npeepers were glued to it like maybe he had found the map to the “Lost \\nDutchman.” I got off on the third floor. \\n\\nI looked at two single rooms. The carpets in them were stained and the \\nfurniture was battered. This was an underworld hotel all right. I could smell \\nthe odor of gangster grass in the hallways. \\n\\nI took the stairs to the fourth floor. I looked into two apartments. I went for \\nthe second one. It was freshly decorated in gold and black paint. The \\nfurniture was blond and new. \\n\\nIt was spotless and flashy. The gold-draped front window gave a wide \\nview of the stem. The pad was perfect for now. It would do until I hit the big \\ntime with a big stable. \\n\\nI went to the elevator and pressed the down button. The floor indicator dial \\n\\n\\n\\nwas stuck between floor number two and three. \\n\\nI took the stairs down. I figured the antics of Maggie and Jiggs had put a \\nlot of pressure on the old joker. Some whore in the hotel was probably down \\nthere with the old coot. They were maybe using the comic book as a guide. \\n\\nI went to the desk. I registered and paid a week’s rent in advance. I put the \\nkey in my pocket and went to the Ford. I drove toward the runt. I saw a black \\nwhore leading a white man into the front door of the Martin Hotel, a hundred \\nyards from the Haven. The runt could take her good tricks there. \\n\\nIt was four a.m. when I got there. I parked and went up the hotel stairs. An \\nelevated train shook the stairway as it passed. Its shadow leaped through the \\nsecond floor window and plunged like a rattling, speeding ghost across the \\nwall. \\n\\nI turned left to number twenty. I twisted my key in the lock and stepped \\ninside. The runt was wide-eyed. She leaped from the bed. She had on red \\nbaby-doll pajamas. She squeezed herself hard against me. She acted like I \\nhad been gone a year. \\n\\nShe said, “Oh Daddy, I am so glad you’re back. I was worried like hell. \\nWhere have you been? Do you love me as much as I love you? Did you miss \\nme? I’d die if anything ever happens to you.” \\n\\nA heart-aching montage tornadoed through my skull. I gritted my teeth. I \\nfelt my fingernails ice-picking into my palms. The runt’s love con had \\nresurrected sad old scenes. \\n\\nI saw poor black Henry. He was on his knees blubbering his love for \\nMama. I saw his pitiful eyes begging Mama not to break his heart. I saw \\nMama kicking herself free of his clutching arms. I saw that terrible look of \\nscorn and triumph on Mama’s face. I thought about the worms that had \\ndevoured his flesh, in his lonely grave. \\n\\nI shuddered and punched the runt with all my might against the left temple. \\nOn impact, needles of pain threaded to my elbow. She moaned and shot \\nbackward onto the bed. She bounced like she was on a trampoline. There was \\na crunching, pulpy thud on the second bounce. She’d crashed face first on the \\nsteel edge at the foot of the bed. \\n\\nShe just lay there breathing hard. I moved to the foot of the bed. I grabbed \\na fist full of hair. I turned her face toward me. Her eyes were closed and there \\nwas a bloody gash just above her right eyebrow. \\n\\nI went to the face bowl and drew a pitcher of cold water. I doused her full \\nin the face. Her eyes flickered open. She just lay looking up at me. A scarlet \\n\\n\\n\\ntrickle ran down her cheek across her chin. \\n\\nShe stroked the side of her face. She saw the blood. Her eyes fullmooned. \\nHer mouth was open. I stood looking down at her. The guts in my scrotum \\nwere twisting. I could feel hot currents firing up that generator at the base of \\nmy weapon. \\n\\nThen she said, “Why Daddy? What did I say to get my ass whipped? Are \\nyou high or what?” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, if I have you a hundred years don’t ever ask me where I \\nbeen. Don’t ever try to play that bullshit love con on me. We’re not squares. \\nI’m a pimp and you’re a whore. Now get up and keep a cold towel on that \\neyebrow.” \\n\\nShe got up and stood at the washbowl washing the blood off. Her big eyes \\nwere staring at me through the mirror. I didn’t know she had started to keep a \\nrevenge score in her skull. Seven years later she would tally up and happily \\ncross me into prison. \\n\\nShe sat on the side of the bed pressing a towel against the wound. I got in \\nthe sack in the raw. In fifteen minutes the leak had stopped. It was now only a \\nsmall puckered slash. \\n\\nShe crawled in beside me. She nibbled at my ear. That lizard did cross¬ \\ncountry laps and then took the boss trek around the world. I lay there silently. \\nI was trying to figure the real reason why I had slugged her. I couldn’t find \\nthe answer. My thoughts were ham strung by the razor-edge of conscience. \\n\\nShe whispered, “Daddy, do you feel like tying me down? Please. I want \\nyou to.” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, you got a one track mind. I’m gonna tie you down like a sow \\nin a slaughter house. After you get your rocks off I’m gonna give you the \\nrundown on that stem you’re working tonight. Get on your back. Stretch your \\nlegs out and put your arms above your head. That’s right you sweet freak \\nbitch.” \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\nDRILLING FOR OIL \\n\\n\\nThat thunderbolt El train had trembled the room a half dozen times. Dawn \\nhad broken through a smeary sky. Fingers of pale gray light poked through \\nthe frayed window shades. \\n\\nShe was lying in my arms. I saw flakes of brown blood beneath her chin. \\nHer heart against my side was sprinting like a wildcat’s facing the hounds. I \\ncould hear the clip-clop of an ice-huckster’s horse. The creaking wagon \\nwheels were in rhythm to his pitch. \\n\\nHe sang, “Ice Man! Ice! A hundred for twenty, fifty for a dime. Keep your \\nwatermelon cold and your pork chops fine, ’vite Old Joe up to chitlins just \\nany old time. Ice Man! Ice!” \\n\\nI thought, “Even the ice man is starving down here. I gotta get down up- \\nthere on that stem. Off Preston’s run-down, that stem must be a sonuvabitch. \\nI gotta down her there. It’s where the scratch is.” \\n\\n“When I rundown to her I have to be cool and confident. I can’t falter and \\ntip her I’m still going to school. I gotta really remember the get down \\nrundown I hustled from those pimps in the joint.” \\n\\nI said, “Phyllis, Daddy’s been out there casing those streets. It’s like \\nwalking in a river of tricky crap. If I had any other bitch but you I would say \\nshe couldn’t go out there and get me some scratch. Baby, I got a lot of \\nconfidence in you. \\n\\n“I know no stud or con bitch can sell you a pig in a poke. In fact I would \\nstand in the Halls of Congress and swear that you would be too busy getting \\nscratch to even listen to bullshit. Am I right so far about you, or have I \\noverrated you?” \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I’m a big girl now. No nickel-slick bastard can steal me \\nfrom you. I ‘you-know-what’ you, and always will. Honey, I just want to be \\n\\n\\n\\nyour little dog and make you a million dollars. \\n\\n“When we get rich maybe you won’t mind if Gay, my daughter, lives with \\nus. She’s only two. She’s so cute and friendly. You’d be crazy about her. My \\naunt in Saint Louis takes care of her.” \\n\\nI thought, “I was sure a sap making like a pimp. Here I’d had her a week \\nand I was flat-footed. I hadn’t heard about a crumb crusher. Worse, I hadn’t \\ngiven her a deep quiz. I really knew nothing about her. It had been the one \\nrundown from the joint I’d goofed. I had been satisfied with the shallow \\nrundown from that sissy barkeep.” \\n\\nThe pimp’s in the joint had said, “There ain’t nothing more important than \\nwhat makes a new bitch tick and why. You gotta scrape her brain. Find out \\nwhether the first joker who layed her was her father or who. Make her tell \\nyou her life story. \\n\\n“If she can remember back in her mammy’s ass, good! Fit all the pieces \\ntogether. Maybe then you’ll know if she’s a two-day package or a two-year \\npackage. Don’t try to play ’em in the dark. Quiz ’em into a crack up if you \\nhave to. Wake ’em up from a dead sleep. Check the answers you got with \\nwhat you get.” \\n\\nI said, “Girl, your rap is right on the scratch. It’s you and me against the \\nworld. I’m gonna make a star out of you. We are going to get rich as cream. \\nYou gotta hump your ass off in those streets. Baby. As soon as we get a big \\nbundle you go cop the kid. Now forget about her until we get in shape. I \\ndon’t want anything in your skull but those tricks out there. \\n\\n“Now listen carefully. I want you to work nothing but the street. Stay out \\nof the bars. Don’t drink, smoke gangster, or use anything while you’re \\nworking. Your skull has got to be sharp and clear out there. Otherwise you \\ncould lose your life, and almost as bad, my scratch. \\n\\n“Believe me, I am not yeasting it. I want you to memorize everything that \\nhappens while you’re working. I want a rundown every night after you knock \\noff. Maybe some stuff player will set you up like tonight and take you off \\ntomorrow night. \\n\\n“Keep those crack-wise Niggers out of your face. If I see you rapping to a \\njasper broad I’m gonna put my foot in your ass. Play for cruising white tricks. \\nSpade tricks are trouble. They all want to make a home. \\n\\n“You’re black and beautiful. They can’t resist you. They are the freaks and \\nthey got the scratch. Ask them for a hundred and take ten. You can go down \\non a price. You can’t go up. Don’t go to nobody’s pad. For a double saw or \\n\\n\\n\\nover take ’em to the Martin down the street from where we are gonna move. \\nFlip out of wheels as much as possible. Flip ’em fast and crack more scratch \\nfor over time. \\n\\n“Your name is Mary Jones. I got enough B.R. to raise you fast. You’re not \\na thief. I don’t need a bondsman or a lip now. You don’t have a sheet. You \\nsee a young girl out there, square or whore, pull her. Be friendly to her. Build \\nme up. You know, tell her how smart and sweet I am. Don’t let no bitch pull \\nyou. This family needs some whores. Don’t bring no junkie bitch to me. Now \\nis there anything you don’t understand?” \\n\\nShe said, “No Daddy, I dig everything. You can wire me if something \\nturns up I don’t dig. Daddy, I am so proud of you. You are so clever and \\nstrong. I feel so safe being your girl. I’m gonna be a star for you.” \\n\\nI had told her all I knew. It was just pimp garbage. What the ninety percent \\nknow to tell a whore. What she really needed to protect herself in those \\nterrible streets were daily rundowns for as long as she was my woman. How \\ncould I rundown the thousand crosses she’d face? \\n\\nAll I knew I’d gotten from the pimps in the joint. They were only fair \\npimps from small towns. None of them had the guts or savvy for this rapid \\ntrack. The runt and me were a pure case of the blind leading the blind. I was \\nbone tired. I had to be fresh for our debut. \\n\\nI said, “Sugar, let’s cop some doss. We got a hectic night coming up. Oh! I \\nforgot, some louse put the heist on your slum. Don’t worry, with what you \\ngot to offer. I’ll have enough scratch soon to score for the real thing. This is \\nour last day in this flophouse. I copped us a jazzy little pad uptown. Sleep \\ntight baby puppy.” \\n\\nShe said, “All right. Daddy. I’m going to sleep. I wonder how Gay is \\ndoing?” \\n\\nWhen I woke up I thought the runt had scalded me with hot grease. I was \\nin a flaming sweat. My ticker was smashing inside my chest like a wrecker’s \\ndemolition ball. That cunning joker playing God had conned me again. I had \\nwhipped my poor mama again. The runt’s frightened big eyes almost touched \\nmine. That puckered gash looked like she had grown an extra cat. \\n\\nShe was saying, “Daddy, Daddy, you all right? It’s your baby, Phyllis. \\nDamn, you had a bitch-kitty nightmare. Was the heat chasing you or \\nsomething?” \\n\\nI said, “No Baby, as a matter of fact, you were in trouble. You had done a \\nstupid thing in the street. You let a Nigger pimp con you into his Hog. It \\n\\n\\n\\nturned out he was a crazy gorilla. He was trying to cut your throat. I saved \\nyou before he croaked you. Dreams often carry warnings. So Bitch, stay out \\nof those pimp’s Hogs.” \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I’m looking for white tricks in Hogs. That’s where the \\nlong scratch is. Ain’t no Nigger pimp going to put my ass in a sling. I’m too \\nslick for that okee doke. You not going to get salty with me about a dream I \\nhope. Daddy, I ain’t going to bullshit out there.” \\n\\nIt was five-twenty. By seven o’clock we had moved to the Blue Haven. \\nThe runt went for the pad. First thing, she lifted the phone off the hook to see \\nif it worked. \\n\\nI said, “Tell your tricks to call you here.” \\n\\nShe laid the bearskin and freaked the joint off with her lights and other \\ncrap. Except for the fake stars, it was a fair mock-up of her pad where I had \\ncopped her. She went to the street to get down at eight. \\n\\nI had told her to work just the block where we padded for a week or so. I \\nwent to the front window. Ten minutes after she got down she broke luck. A \\nwhite trick in a thirty-seven Buick picked her up. I timed her. She had \\nracehorse speed. She was back on the track in nine and a half minutes. \\n\\nA black pretty broad could sure scratch a white man’s itch fast. I watched \\nher scratch three. I showered and got as pretty as I could. I made an urgent \\nskull note to cop a hot vine connection. I also needed a gangster and cocaine \\ncontact. I got the elevator. I left the key at the desk. I had told the runt to \\ncheck her scratch past forty slats into the toe of my tan Stetsons. \\n\\nI got into the Ford. I waved to the runt on my way to the Roost. It sure was \\na thrill to have a young fine bitch humping for me. \\n\\nI parked across the street from the Roost. I dabbed a sponge into the box of \\nSun Glow face powder in the glove compartment. I made my face up into an \\neven, glowing tan. I got out and crossed the street toward the Roost. \\n\\nIt was ten-thirty. The sky was a fresh, bright bitch. This first April night \\nhad gone sucker and gifted her with a shimmering bracelet of diamond stars. \\nThe fat moon lurked like an evil yellow eye staring down at the pimps, \\nhustlers, and whores hawk-eyeing for a mark, a cop. \\n\\nI felt the raw tenderness of first April winds lashing at the hem of my white \\nalligator. I felt the birth stirrings of that poisonous pimp’s rapture. I felt \\npowerful and beautiful. \\n\\nI thought, “I was still black in the white man’s world. My hope to be \\nimportant and admired could be realized even behind this black stockade. It \\n\\n\\n\\nwas simple, just pimp my ass off and get a ton of scratch. Everybody in both \\nworlds kissed your ass black and blue if you had flash and front.” \\n\\nI was six storefronts away from the Roost. He stood in the center of the \\nsidewalk. I looked down at him. He was a foot shorter than the runt. He \\nlooked like a black baby who had taken ugly pills. His head was the size of a \\ngiant pumpkin. His voice was a squeal like a clappy joker makes when the \\ncroaker rams a sound down his dingus. \\n\\nHe squealed, “Shine ’em up, Hot Shot. If I had your ‘hand’ I’d throw mine \\naway. Get on bigtime. Shines ain’t but a dime. Shine ’em up.” \\n\\nI looked down at my Stomps. They could stand a gloss all right. I followed \\nthe pointing, gnarled finger to the dwarf’s open-air stand. It sat at the mouth \\nof a gangway between two buildings. The red fringes of its tattered canvas \\ntop rippled in the breeze. \\n\\nI climbed into the chair. The dwarf was slapping polish on my Stetsons. A \\nthin stud with at least a half a grand in threads on his back took the other \\nchair. He was wearing silver nail polish. He was reeking with perfume. \\n\\nA gleaming black custom Duesenberg eased into the curb in front of me. \\nThe top was down. My peepers did a triple take. \\n\\nA huge stud was sitting in the back seat. He had an ocelot in his lap dozing \\nagainst his chest. The cat was wearing a stone-studded collar. A gold chain \\nwas strung to it. \\n\\nHe was sitting between two spectacular high-yellow whores. His diamonds \\nwere blazing under the streetlight. Three gorgeous white whores were in the \\nfront seat. He looked exactly like Boris Karloff in black-face. \\n\\nHe was rapping something. All five of those whores were turned toward \\nhim. They were listening and paying attention like he was God giving them a \\npass to Heaven. He could have been running down a safe place to hide \\nbecause the world was coming to an end. \\n\\nI said, “Who is that?” \\n\\nThe dwarf said, “You gotta be from outta town. That Sweet Jones. He’s the \\ngreatest Nigger pimp in the world.” \\n\\nThe thin joker said, “That spotted cat. Miss Peaches, is the only bitch he \\ncares lives or croaks. Shit, them whores you pinning ain’t but half the stable. \\nIf they got Nigger pimps in outer space, he’s the best of them, too. He’s \\ngonna take them whores into the Roost and pop some. He’s lugging twenty \\nG’s in his raise. Ain’t no heist man crazy enough to stick him up though. He \\ncroaks Niggers for his recreation.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI couldn’t believe what I saw. This was only nineteen-thirty-eight. Those \\nDuesenbergs cost a fortune. He must have been the only black pimp in the \\ncountry who owned one. My peepers jacked off just watching him and those \\nhigh-powered whores. It was as exciting as maybe Christ making his encore. \\n\\nThe dwarf had shined my Stomps. I gave him a buck. I sat there and \\nwatched Sweet Jones and those whores get out of the Duesenberg and walk \\ntoward the Roost. The black-spotted cat slinked beside him. \\n\\nI thought, “Tonight I got to cut into him. I got to be careful so I don’t blow \\nhim. The cut in has to be in the Roost. I’ll go in and cook up something in \\nthere.” \\n\\nI got off the stand. I passed Poison’s problem whore. She was sitting \\nbeside a joker in a red Hog. She had a bottle of gin in her jib turned straight \\nup. As I neared the Roost I saw old Preston trying to shoo two marks into the \\nGreek’s joint. Just as I turned into the Roost he bucked his eyes and jerked \\nhis thumb at me. He was tipping me Sweet was in the Roost. I nodded my \\nhead and went in. \\n\\nIt was an off night for the combo. The jukebox was grinding out “Pennies \\nFrom Heaven.” The joint hadn’t crowded yet. There were maybe a half dozen \\ncouples in the booths. Sweet Jones and his whores were the only people at the \\nlog. They were in the center. The cat was licking her paws beneath Sweet’s \\nstool. I sat at the log near the front door facing him and the stable. The pretty \\nMexican broad was standing in front of him. \\n\\nSweet was buying the house a drink. She served his party. She glanced at \\nme. She remembered my drink. She brought me a Planter’s Punch on Sweet. \\nThe floor waitress loaded a tray from the log and served the couples in the \\nbooths all on Sweet. \\n\\nI sat there studying Sweet. He had to be six feet six. His face was like a \\nblack steel mask. Not a flicker of emotion played over it. He kept smashing \\nthe heels of his brute-sized hands together like he was crushing an invisible \\nthroat. \\n\\nEven at a distance it made me edgy. I guess it kept his whores on the brink \\nof peeing on themselves. If he had smiled maybe they would have dropped \\ndead from shock. He sure proved pimping wasn’t a charm contest. \\n\\nThose whores lit his cigarette. They took turns feeding him sips of his \\nCoke. They fought to ram their noses up his ass. \\n\\nI froze; one of the white broads was whispering in his ear. Those unearthly \\ngray eyes of his in the ebony sockets were staring at me. I could hear the thud \\n\\n\\n\\nof those meat sledges. \\n\\nI thought, “Christ Almighty! Mama darling, I hope my double hasn’t put \\nthe muscle on this broad for some snatch or scratch. Please don’t let this \\nbroad bum-finger me!” \\n\\nHe slid his terrible pearl-gray peepers off me. I saw him pound the bottom \\nof his glass against the log. The Mexican broad expressed to him. He was \\nrapping to her. She was nodding her head and looking down the log at me. \\n\\nMy Stetsons on the stool rung were slamming together like the heels of a \\nFlamenco Dancer. The jukebox was sobbing Lady Day’s beef about her mean \\nbut sweet man. I wondered if I’d see the runt again, and if not, how soon \\nshe’d get another ass kicker. \\n\\nThe couples in the booths were bug-eying the arena. It was maybe like the \\nCircus Maximus. The doomed Christian, me, pitted against the king of beasts, \\nhim, plus the ocelot. \\n\\nThe Mexican broad came slowly toward me. Her face was tight and serious \\nas she stood before me. She had pity in her peepers. She hated capital \\npunishment. \\n\\nShe said, “Mr. Jones wants you to come to him pronto.” \\n\\nShe turned and walked away. I staggered to my feet. I started hoofing that \\nthousand miles to Mr. Jones. On the way I dusted off the hundred-and- \\nseventy-five I. Q. in my skull. \\n\\nI got to him. The cat snarled under the stool. It pasted its yellow eyes on \\nme. I jerked my eyes from the cat and kept them riveted to the floor. I was \\nafraid to look into Sweet’s glowing peepers up close. I knew I’d crap in my \\npants. \\n\\nHe whirled around on his stool, his back to the log. I glued my peepers to \\nthe tapping tips of his needle-toed patent leather stomps. I flinched at each \\ncrash of his huge hooks. \\n\\nHe whispered, “Nigger, you know who I am? Look at me when I’m \\nspieling to you.” \\n\\nThat teletype in my skull hammered out the escape hatch. \\n\\nIt read, “For this maniac you gotta be just like a Mississippi Nigger. You \\ngotta pretend he’s a white lynch-mob leader. You gotta con him, but be \\ncareful, don’t get cute. Keep your nose square in his ass. Jeff it out all the \\nway.” \\n\\nI said, “Sure I know who you are Mr. Jones. You’re the black God of the \\nsporting world. Ain’t a Nigger alive, unless he’s stupid and deaf, that ain’t \\n\\n\\n\\nheard your fame and name ring. The reason I don’t look at you is because I \\nremember what happened to that sucker in the Bible that snitched a peep.” \\n\\nHis whores broke out into gales of laughter. Miss Peaches wasn’t a lady. \\nShe broke wind and grinned. Those patent-leather toes stopped tapping. \\nCould I be selling it? \\n\\nHe reached out and grabbed my chin. He held my head up and cupped it in \\nhis giant hook. I flexed my belly to take up the slack in my bowels. Those \\ndeadly gray slits almost slugged me into a dead faint. When he opened his Jib \\nI saw spidery webs of spit for an instant bridge his fat lips. \\n\\nHe said, “Little Nigger, who are you and where you from? You kinda look \\nlike me. Maybe I layed your Mammy, huh?” \\n\\nI neatly side-stepped his booby trap. \\n\\nI said, “Mr. Jones, I’m nobody trying in your world to be somebody. I was \\nborn right here in your town. Could be my Mammy went for you. What bitch \\nwouldn’t? If I was a bitch I’d give you some scratch to get some.” \\n\\nHe said, “Nigger, you like fine white pussy? This dog of mine wants you \\nto lay her. I give my whores what they want. You going to lay her for a \\ndouble saw? \\n\\nMy skull raced out the warning, “Fool! Watch your ass!” \\n\\nI said, “Mr. Jones, I don’t want no kind of a pussy unless it hangs on my \\nown whore. Mr. Jones, I’m a pimp, like you. I don’t want nothing but some \\npimp scratch. My principles won’t let me turn no reverse trick. \\n\\n“Mr. Jones, I ain’t no party freak. I want to be great like you. I ain’t never \\ngoing to amount to anything if I screw up the rules of the pimp game. You \\nthe greatest pimp on Earth. You got great pimping by the rules. Would you \\nwant a poor dumb pimp like me to chump out at the start?” \\n\\nHis freak white woman pouted at his side. She begged Nero to flip his \\nthumbs down. \\n\\nShe said, “Mr. Jones, make this pretty punk freak off with your baby. You \\ndon’t let nobody say no to you. Since he’s dreaming he’s a pimp it will be \\nwild kicks for me. Force him, Daddy, force him. Show him who’s boss. Sic \\nMiss Peaches on him.” \\n\\nHe shoved her aside. The boa constrictor uncoiled from around my chest. I \\nsaw contempt paint over the skull and crossed bones in his peepers. I drew a \\ndeep breath. \\n\\nHe roared, “You little pissy, green-ass Nigger. You a pimp? You can’t \\nspell pimp. You couldn’t make a pimple on a pimp’s ass. Nigger, I’ll blow \\n\\n\\n\\nyour head off through that ceiling. Don’t let the word pimp come outta your \\njib in my presence. Now get outta my face. Pussy. I oughta stick my swipe in \\nyour jib.” \\n\\nThe cat slithered from under the stool. She crouched on her belly and \\nstared up at me. \\n\\nI wasn’t David. Good thing I wasn’t. I was sure mad at the kooky bastard. I \\ngrinned and fished a fin out. I tossed it on the log and dragged tail out the \\ndoor to the street. I was glad I hadn’t stacked that sling-shot switch blade in \\nmy pocket against that thirty-eight magnum stuck beneath Goliath’s belt. \\n\\nThe door smacked Preston a hard shot in the forehead. He had been \\npeeping through a slat in the door blind. He rubbed his head. He looked \\nscared. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, I told you he’s nuts. You keep it up, a ground hog will be \\nyour mailman. To play it safe you better give me your Mama’s address. I \\ngotta know where to ship your corpse. Where you going now?” \\n\\nI said, “Look Preston, I didn’t cut into him. He cut into me. Hell, I ain’t no \\nhead-shrinker. I couldn’t handle the maniac. I’m splitting to the Ford to \\nthink.” \\n\\nHe was clucking his jib when I walked away from him. I collapsed onto \\nthe Ford’s seat. I was stinking from the fear-sweat in the bar. My pants were \\nsoggy. \\n\\nI saw the white broad that was burning to freak off with me. She was \\nholding the Roost door open. Sweet filed out. His whores strutted out behind \\nhim. They walked behind him to the Duesenberg. \\n\\nA tall brown-skin joker with a gleaming head of processed hair got out of a \\nred Hog. He was the gutty stud I saw pouring that gin down Poison’s girl. \\n\\nSweet’s stable had gotten into the Duesenberg. The shiny-topped joker and \\nSweet were rapping on the sidewalk. They pounded each other on the back. \\nThey looked like boon buddies. Miss Peaches stood lashing her tail at \\nSweet’s side. \\n\\nI almost leaped out of my hide. It was Preston banging on the car window. \\nI unlocked the door. He slid in. His peepers were ballooning, looking past me \\nto Sweet on the other side of the street. \\n\\nHe was sucking air like a mackerel on the beach. He was shoving a rusty \\nowl-head twenty-two pistol across the seat. He was trembling like the zero \\nsecond had come to assassinate maybe F.D.R. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, you sitting here hating him, ain’t you? You despise his guts. \\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the way you was looking at him. A bastard like him ain’t got a right to \\nlive on God’s green Earth. \\n\\n“Do yourself and the world a favor, Kid. Take this rod and walk sneaky \\nlike down that sidewalk while he’s rapping to Glass Top. Stick the barrel in \\nhis ear and pull the trigger. Then quick, blow the cat’s brains out. It’s easy. \\nKid. You can do it. \\n\\n“Every Nigger in the country will love you. Kid, it’s your chance to get \\ngreat. Go on, Kid, do it now. You ain’t never gonna get a choicer chance.” \\n\\nI said, “Preston, I’m not hip to the murder game. I don’t want to get hip to \\nit. I don’t want to blow his brains out on that sidewalk and waste them. I want \\nhis brains to work inside my skull. You getting old, Preston. You can’t even \\ndent the mustard. He screwed you around a thousand times worse than me. \\n\\n“You can’t lose for winning. Why don’t you be the hero and croak him. \\nLook Preston, take that tommy gun and split. I like you, but give me a break, \\nhuh? I’ve had a funky night and my skull needs a change.” \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, you think I ain’t got the guts? He ruined me, Kid. He \\ndestroyed me. He’s just another Nigger. He ain’t no bear, and that cat ain’t no \\ntiger. I’m going over there right now and cash them out.” \\n\\nOld Preston sprang out of the car. I watched him all the way. That game \\nleg had him tilting from side to side. He looked like one of those doughty \\n“Spirit of Seventy-Six” jokers on the posters around the Fourth of July. \\n\\nI wondered if he was tanked up with enough rot-gut moxie to really fold \\nSweet’s dukes for good across his chest. Preston was on the other side of the \\nstreet only twenty feet from Sweet and Glass Top. His mitt was rammed into \\nhis benny pocket keeping the rod warm and ready. Preston’s shoulders and \\nback were stiff and straight. Sweet’s back was toward me. He was facing the \\nsidewalk. \\n\\nI thought, “The old Dingbat may do it. He sure had reasons. Sweet put the \\nhurt to him all right. Will there be much gore? Will Sweet croak right away \\nor flop around on the street like a chicken with its head wrung off? Will Miss \\nPeaches leap up and cut Preston’s throat? \\n\\n“If Preston croaks him I’ll have to cut into Poison. I’ll bleed his skull. He \\nwill be top pimp. Maybe a couple of those ten whores Sweet’s got will go for \\nme. I’d be some kind of sonuvabitching young pimp in a Duesenberg. \\n\\nPreston came abreast of Sweet. He had slowed to an amble. I could see his \\nyellow mitt easing out of his pocket. He got maybe three feet past Sweet and \\nstopped. He was going to do it! He was coming back for a fatal flank sneak. \\n\\n\\n\\nAt that instant Sweet turned his buffalo head and looked down at Preston. \\nMiss Peaches stiffened. I saw a black cavern open in Preston’s toothless \\nyellow face. The chicken-hearted bastard had been chilled by those awful \\ngray orbs and the cat. He was grinning at Sweet. He scooted his empty hand \\nout of his pocket. \\n\\nPreston might have made it if Sweet hadn’t turned those lights on him. Old \\nPreston bowed his bald head. He walked toward the Greek’s joint. His \\nshoulders were sagging. His back was a stooped slouch. Old Preston had \\nmissed his choice chance at glory. \\n\\nI just sat watching Sweet and trying to plot a way to cut into him. It looked \\nhopeless. Finally, Sweet got in the rear seat of his Duesenberg. The cat \\nleaped into his lap. One of the white broads roared it away. I saw Glass Top \\npat his greasy dome as he turned into the Roost. \\n\\nI thought, “That glossy-top stud with a face like a pretty whore’s might be \\nthe tunnel to Sweet.” \\n\\nI took my sponge out and freshened my makeup. I got out of the Ford and \\nwalked to the Roost. The joint was getting crowded. I was lucky. There was \\nan empty stool in the middle of the log. \\n\\nThe beautiful joker was on a stool next to it. The memory of that four-slat \\ntip out of the fin sent the tamale skidding to me. I sipped my Planter’s Punch. \\nI drummed my Stetsons against the stool legs. Hamp’s “Flying Home” was \\nrocking the joint. \\n\\nA pack of white broads had a booth behind me. They looked like they had \\nbeen to a P.T.A. meeting. Their perfume sent a medley of sexy odors through \\nthe joint. They were flirting their cans off. I guess they were writers. They \\nwere maybe doing urgent research on the “Sexual Habits of the Black Male.” \\n\\nI wasted no time. I was afraid the pretty joker might split. I snatched my \\neyes from the excited pack in the mirror. I turned my head toward him and \\ntouched him lightly on the sleeve. \\n\\nHe was sure a wrong doer all right. He frogged at least three inches off his \\nstool. It was like I’d stabbed him in the butt with a red-hot poker. He turned \\nhis shocked face toward mine. His silky long-lashed eyes were popped wide \\nin alarm. He had panicked like maybe a cute nun caught naked in the Priest’s \\nbedroom by the Mother Superior. \\n\\nI said, “Jeez, excuse me, Jim. I didn’t know you were in deep thought. I’m \\nsorry I hit on you like a square. My name is Young Blood. I’m a friend of \\nPreston’s. You must be the fabulous Glass Top. It would be a boss honor to \\n\\n\\n\\nbuy you a taste.” \\n\\nHe patted his shiny mop and said, “Yeah, Man, I’m Glass Top. What’s \\nyour stupid story? You young studs sure ain’t got no finesse. It drags me to \\nget hit on like that. When somebody touches me I like to be digging it and \\nfacing the stud, you know? \\n\\n“I ain’t salty. I dig you ain’t nothing but a punk that needs his coat pulled \\nto social polish and class. I ain’t no lush. You can spring for a Coke if you \\nwant. Tell her to sugar it heavy.” \\n\\nThe Mexican broad spooned sugar into a glass and brought his Coke. He \\nstirred it with a straw. He raised the glass to drink. I noticed ugly black tracks \\ntracing the veins on his light-brown mitt. He was a junkie for sure. He would \\nknow where to cop C, and probably gangster for the runt. He was also a pal \\nof Sweet’s. Maybe I could make a two-bird killing here. \\n\\nHe said, “So, you know Preston? What’s your racket? You a till tapper or \\nmaybe a burglar, huh?” \\n\\nI said, “I been knowing Preston since I was a kid. I used to buff his stomps \\nwhen he was pimping. I’m no till tapper or burglar. I’m a pimp. You must be \\na pimp yourself. I saw you rapping to the best pimp there is.” \\n\\nHe said, “You a pimp? I ain’t never heard of you. Where you been \\npimping, in Siberia? Sweet ain’t the best pimp there is. I am. Pimps are just \\nlike cars. The best known ain’t no real yardstick to the best car. It’s like I’m a \\nDuesenberg and Sweet’s a Ford. I got all the quality and beauty. He’s got all \\nthe advertising and all the luck. \\n\\n“Sweet’s got ten whores, I got five. These whores in town ain’t hip to how \\ngreat I am yet. When they wake up to me I’ll have to fight ’em off with a \\nbaseball bat. How many girls you got?” \\n\\nI said, “I only got one girl now. I just got out of the joint, but I’m going to \\nhave ten in a year. This town will hear about me. I was thinking about cutting \\ninto some top pimp like Sweet. I’m not stupid enough to think I don’t need to \\nlearn a thousand times more about pimping than I know. I also need \\nconnections like for girl and gangster. I’m just a kid in darkness waiting for \\nsome brain to help light the way.” \\n\\nHe said, “Stay cool, Blood. I just remembered I left my kitty’s slammer \\nopen. I’ll be back after I lock it.” \\n\\nI looked in the mirror and saw him go out. He turned left towards the \\nGreek’s joint. I knew he was going to Preston to check me out. When he \\nwalked out that panting pack behind me turned as one. It was like Gary Grant \\n\\n\\n\\nhad walked out. \\n\\nThe jukebox was moaning gut-bucket blues. Some joker was singing \\n“Going down slow; Don’t send no Doctor; Doctor sure can’t do no good; \\nPlease write my mother, tell her the shape I’m in; I’m going down slow.” \\n\\nI remembered it had been my father’s favorite record. He had kept it \\nspinning on the rich Victrola. I remembered his shocked face there in the \\ndoorway when he discovered it and everything else gone. I wondered if he \\nwere alive and still in town. If I ran into him I sure wouldn’t know what to \\nsay to him after all these years. \\n\\nI saw the silk chicks crane their necks toward the door. I switched my eyes \\nleft in the mirror. I saw Glass Top coming in. Those chickens were clucking \\nwhen he sat down. \\n\\nI said, “Jack, aren’t you afraid those silk broads behind us will rape you?” \\n\\nHe said, “Shit, if you stripped and searched all of ’em you wouldn’t find a \\nC note. They ain’t nothing but square housewives. They sick of that half-ass \\nscrewing at home. They laying to swindle chump Niggers outta their youth. \\n\\n“They know enough on each other to keep all their jibs sealed. Ain’t a \\nchance for their husbands to tumble to what’s going on. So what if some \\nwhite joker who knows ’em made this scene and saw ’em? Everyone of ’em \\nis just slumming out with the girls. Jack, what they got is a secret sex club.” \\n\\nI said, “Top, I’m frayed. I sure wish I had a snort of girl. Can you score?” \\n\\nHe told me, “Blood, I believe you are a down young stud. I got news for \\nyou. You can score right with me. I got the best girl and boy in town. Even \\nmy reefer is dynamite. Blood, I love you. You got heart. How much stuff you \\nwant?” \\n\\nI said, “What’s the bite for girl?” \\n\\n“A fin a number-five cap. A sixteenth for a C. A piece for a grand. I got a \\ncozy pad around the corner. There you can fly to the moon, Pimping Buddy.” \\n\\nI said, “Top, let’s split to your pad. If your girl is mellow I’ll maybe go for \\na C note.” \\n\\nI threw a fin on the log. The Mexican showed me her choppers like I was \\nher dentist. Three square black studs were standing rapping to the purring \\npack in the booth. \\n\\nWe went out and got in Glass Top’s Hog. My foot struck a bottle. I looked \\ndown. It was the dead gin soldier Poison’s whore had sucked dry. The Hog \\nshot from the curb like a red torpedo. Eckstein’s syrupy “Cottage For Sale” \\noozed from the Hog’s radio. \\n\\n\\n\\nI thought, “I sure gotta hurry and get my ass into a Hog at least. I’ll cop a \\nDuesenberg in maybe a year. Geez, it must be one-thirty. I shoulda checked \\non the runt. My luck is changing though. This glossy-top joker is my in to \\nSweet.” \\n\\nHe lived in a plush apartment building. It had all the jazz. Technicolored \\nlights spotlighted the exterior. Fake rubber plants stood tall in the foyer. \\n\\nWe took a chrome-and-brass elevator to his second-floor pad. Thick red \\nbroadloom carpet wall to wall in the hall. Fresh black and gold paint sparkled \\nthe walls and ceilings. \\n\\nA Polynesian-type dream took our bennys and my lid in a small silver- \\nmirrored entrance hall. My feet sank into the soft lavender carpet. I could \\nhear the deep-throated boom of a console phonograph. The Ink Spots’ lead \\ntenor was parfaiting “Whispering Grass.” \\n\\nI followed Top and the olive-tinted beauty into the womb-like living room. \\nDouble heavy lavender drapes covered the windows. Not a beam of street \\nlight or sunshine could violate this pimp’s lair. \\n\\nTop and I sat on a long gray sofa. It had cost him a big buck to lower the \\nceiling with the silver lame fabric. The only light came from the glass-topped \\ncocktail table. It gurgled and flashed a pale blue light. \\n\\nA score of yellow, red, and orange tropical fish streaked inside the \\naquarium built six inches below the tabletop. Two gray rubber hoses at each \\nend of the tank ran down into the lavender carpet. It was a slick drain off and \\nfresh water gimmick. \\n\\nThe broad was almost naked. She stood wide legged in front of us like a \\nbellhop waiting for orders. The table’s blue light behind her silhouetted her \\nCoca Cola bottle curves inside the flame red shortie gown. I saw a four-inch \\ncone of jet hair between her thighs. She had a rare cat with that extra \\ndimension. I unglued my eyes and looked into her face. She had the dreamy \\neyes of a freakish “Mona Lisa.” \\n\\nHe said, “Bitch, bring a coupla outfits and some caps of girl and boy. Oh \\nyeah, Blood, this is Radell.” \\n\\nThat awesome round butt of her’s jiggled as she wiggled past me. The big \\nwhite phonograph in the corner was booming out a novelty tune. “When your \\npipes get dry then you know you’re high. Everything is dandy. You truck on \\ndown to the candy store but you don’t get no peppermint candy. Then you \\nknow your body’s sent, you don’t care if you don’t pay rent. Light a tea and \\nlet it be if you’re a viper.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“This pretty gowster is sure pimping his ass off,” I thought. \\n\\n“He’s a crazy gowster if he thinks he’ll con me into banging any \\n\\nH. I’m not even sure about shooting the girl. Of course, I can’t come off \\nlike a hayseed either.” \\n\\nI said, “Jim, you sure ain’t jiving. Your layout is a sonuvabitch.” \\n\\nHe said, “I got five bedrooms here. These whores on this fast track dig \\nfront and flash. You can’t pimp here unless you got ’em. Jack, this C I got \\nain’t going to let you split for awhile. You may as well shed your threads and \\nget in the groove.” \\n\\nThe broad brought the outfits, a spoon and a dozen white and brown caps. \\nShe put them on the cocktail table. She slid it closer to us. The water tidal- \\nwaved in the tank. The fish darted in a frenzy. She stooped and started \\nunlacing Top’s shoes. I reached into my pocket for a C note. I had peeled it \\noff from my crotch stash before leaving the Haven. \\n\\nHe said, “This flight is on me. It’s a sample. You can cop what you want \\nlater.” \\n\\nWe stripped our clothes off to our shorts. His were candy-striped silk. I felt \\nlike a bum in my white cotton jocks. \\n\\nThe broad draped our clothes on each arm of the gray overstuffed chair \\nacross the room. She didn’t have any of my scratch in her mit when she came \\naway. She stood next to me. The phone on the end table beside him jangled. \\nHe uncradled it. \\n\\nHe said, “Castle of Joy, what’s your desire? Oh yeah, Angelo, she’s here. \\nHell no she ain’t dossing. She’s on her way.” \\n\\nHe hung up and said, “Bitch, just slip your benny on and get downtown to \\nthat head bellboy at the Franklin Arms. Dimples and the other girls are \\ngetting more action than they can turn. Take the key to the kitty and get there \\nfast.” \\n\\nThe broad zipped out of there in less than three minutes. She sure liked \\ngetting her man some money. Those tricks at the Franklin were going to give \\ntheir swipes a treat all right. \\n\\nI thought, “I gotta make the runt cultivate her cat like that broad’s.” \\n\\nHe said, “That’s a good young bitch I got there. I copped her in Hawaii a \\nyear ago. There are twenty-thousand white suckers in town for a convention. \\nThey got a double saw in one hand and their swipes in the other. \\n\\n“Radell ain’t had no sleep in thirty-six hours. My other four whores been \\nhumping at the Franklin since early this morning. I can’t miss a five G score \\n\\n\\n\\nfor the three days even with Angelo’s thirty percent off the top. Ain’t but a C \\na day for a girl in oil for the heat.” \\n\\nHe got up and whistled our belts through the loops in our pants. He walked \\nback and started to coil my belt around my arm just above the elbow hollow. \\n\\n“Look Top, I’m not a square,” I said, “but I ain’t shooting no H. I’m game \\nto bang some C. I’ve been curious to try it like that.” \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, I ain’t squeezing your balls to hip you that after Mink \\ncomes Sable. Ain’t nothing a greater blast than horse. It’s your privilege to \\nwake up slow if you want. Horse is what puts the ice in a pimp’s game.” \\n\\nHe upended a cap of girl into the spoon and stuck an eyedropper into the \\nfish tank. He pressed the bulb and drew the dropper full. He emptied it into \\nthe spoon. He held the yellow flame of a table lighter beneath the spoon and \\ntook a tiny wad of cotton from an ashtray. He tossed it into the bowl of the \\nspoon and then wrapped a thin piece of cellophane around the tip of the \\ndropper. He fitted the needle on it. He stuck the hollow end of the needle into \\nthe cotton and drew the dropper full. \\n\\nI felt my blood smashing against the tight coils of the belt. I saw the veins \\nballoon in the throbbing hollow. I smelled the sharp sicklysweet odor of the \\ncocaine. My palms were dripping sweat. He had the spike in his right hand. \\nHe grabbed my forearm with his left hand. I turned my head and closed my \\neyes. I bit down on my bottom lip waiting for the stabbing plunge of the \\nneedle. \\n\\nHe said, “Damn! You got some beautiful lines.” \\n\\nI shivered when it daggered in. I opened my eyes and looked. My blood \\nhad shot up into the dropper. He was pressing the bulb. I saw the blood- \\nstreaked liquid draining into me. It was like a ton of nitro exploded inside me. \\nMy ticker went berserk. I could feel it clawing up my throat. It was like I had \\na mill ion swipes in every pore from head to toe. It was like they were all \\npopping off together in a nerveshredding climax. \\n\\nI was quivering like a joker in the hot seat at the first jolt. I tried to open \\nmy talc-dry mouth. I couldn’t. I was paralyzed. I could feel a hot ball of puke \\nracing up from my careening guts. I saw the green, stinking puke rope arch \\ninto the black mouth of the wastebasket. I felt the cool metal against my \\nchest. I saw Top’s manicured fingers pressing it close to me. \\n\\nHe was saying, “You’ll be all right in a minute. Kid. You thought I was \\nbullshitting when I told you I had the best stuff in town.” \\n\\nI still couldn’t say anything. I felt like the top of my skull had been crushed \\n\\n\\n\\nin. It was like I had been blown apart and all that was left were my eyes. \\nThen tiny prickly feet of ecstasy started dancing through me. I heard \\nmelodious bells tolling softly inside my skull. \\n\\nI looked down at my hands and thighs. A thrill shot through me. Surely \\nthey were the most beautiful in the Universe. I felt a superman’s surge of \\npower. \\n\\nI thought, “It was a cinch that any stud as beautiful and clever as me would \\nbecome the greatest pimp in history. What bitch could resist me? I turned and \\nstared at the ugly stud beside me.” \\n\\nHe said, “Did you hear those chapel bells? Ain’t they a bitch. Kid?” \\n\\n“Yeah man, I heard ’em loud and clear. Right now I’d like to see the bitch \\nI couldn’t make. It’s sure wild to bang girl. The only time I’ll snort after this \\nis when I’m in the street between bangs.” \\n\\nHe said, “Blood, you sure know what to say. Just don’t forget where to \\ncop. The more you buy, the cheaper I’ll make it. I love you. Blood. We gonna \\nbe tight.” \\n\\nHe had a time trying to bang himself. He was only around thirtytwo, but \\nmost of his veins had folded. He finally hit pay clay in his inner right thigh. \\nHe kept the needle in, pumping the horse into the vein then drawing it out. \\n\\nI said, “Jack, why the hell do you screw around like that?” \\n\\nHe said, “Man, you ain’t hip? That’s where the thrill is. When I jack this \\njoint off the horse kicks my ass groovy.” \\n\\nI lost tally of time while we sat on the sofa and banged stuff. After the \\nsecond cap I started banging myself. After that first bang the thrill wasn’t as \\ngood and sharp. Top was coasting. There were three caps of H still on the \\ntabletop. There was no girl. I had banged five caps of girl. I looked at my \\nMickey. It was five a.m. I went to my clothes and started to dress. My ticker \\nwas speeding inside my frosty chest. \\n\\nI said, “Top, I gotta split I want a sixteenth of girl and a can of reefer. \\nHere’s a C note and twenty slats.” \\n\\nHe pulled up from the sofa. He took the scratch and went into a bedroom. \\nHe came out and handed me a tobacco can sealed with rubber bands. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, I put a coupla yellows in your bag so you can come down \\nand get some doss. Where you padding? You don’t wanta walk through the \\nstreet with that package of sizzle on you. I’ll call a cab.” \\n\\nI said, “Thanks Top. I’m padding at the Blue Haven, but my wheels are \\njust around the corner across from the Roost. I’ll hoof it there. The fresh air \\n\\n\\n\\nwill be a kick.” \\n\\nI stood at the living room doorway to the entrance hall. He was uncapping \\na thing of horse. \\n\\nI thought, “Now’s the time to crack on him to sew up the cut into Sweet. I \\ngotta phrase it right. This joker envies Sweet.” \\n\\nI said, “Top, I was thinking how much more common sense and cool you \\ngot than your pal Sweet.” \\n\\nHis hands froze. His eyes beat his mouth to the question. I knew Preston \\nhadn’t told him about my clash with Sweet. I guess Preston’s chicken act had \\nblocked Sweet out of his mind. \\n\\nTop said, “You know Sweet personally?” \\n\\n“I met him last night in the Roost. That tall blonde of his wanted me to \\nfreak-off with her. Sweet offered me a double saw to do the job. I stood on \\npimp principle and turned him down. He flipped his cork. He forced me to \\nsplit. He told me he’d blow my head through the ceiling. I figured he might \\ndo it. \\n\\n“I guess now I have blown my chance to get acquainted with him. I don’t \\nsuppose anybody in town is strong enough with him to square me and cut me \\ninto him. As foxy as you are Top, I wouldn’t be shocked if you couldn’t cut \\nit. After all, the man is complicated. Come to think about it Top, I don’t have \\na real need to meet him since I met you. \\n\\n“My main reason now is I don’t want a crazy enemy like that. So if you tell \\nme it’s over your head, I’ll forget it, stay out of his way and take my chances. \\nI love you Top, and I wouldn’t want anything to happen to you on my \\naccount.” \\n\\nHe gobbled it raw and whole. He flung his girlish head back and roiled off \\nthe sofa to the floor. He held his elbows against his belly and laughed like I’d \\ntold the funniest joke human ears had ever heard. He was gasping when he \\nfinally stopped. He patted his mop. \\n\\n“Sweet ain’t dangerous, sucker,” he began. “He ain’t never croaked \\nanything but yellow Niggers. He’s croaked four of them in the last twenty \\nyears. He ain’t croaked nobody in over two years. He’s ninety percent Bull \\nscare. He don’t kill nobody unless they bad mouth him or muscle his whores. \\n\\n“But he sure hates white folks. He pimps awful tough on white whores. \\nWhen he puts his foot in their asses he’s really doing it to the white man. He \\nsays he’s paying ’em back for what they done and are doing to black people. \\nHis brain is rotted from hate. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Shit, he probably wouldn’t know you if he saw you again. He wasn’t salty \\nwith you for turning down the freak-off. He was playing strong con on his \\nwhite whore. He’s got his whores thinking he’s God. Even a square from \\nDelaware should know God ain’t going to kiss your ass when you tell him no, \\nyou poor boob. \\n\\n“I tell you what. I gotta take him some stuff this weekend. I’ll buzz your \\ncrib to let you know just when. I’ll stop on the way and pick you up. I’ll take \\nyou with me to his pad. He ain’t nothing but a big ugly Nigger with a filthy \\nloud mouth.” \\n\\nI said, “I pad in four-twenty under the name of Lancaster. Top, you gotta \\noverlook my dumbness. I told you I was just a kid in darkness needing some \\nbrain to light the way. Top, I sure appreciate your coat-pulling. See you later. \\nPal.” \\n\\nHe said, “All right Kid, keep that sizzle in your mitt so you can down it in \\na hurry. Oh yeah, you can cop a spike at any drug store. You gotta crack for \\ninsulin with it.” \\n\\nI walked into the entrance hall. I flicked my sponge across my greasy face \\nin the silver mirror. I went out the door to the elevator. It opened on the \\nground floor. I flinched before the stark morning light. \\n\\nOut on the sidewalk, I saw Glass Top’s red Hog pulling to the curb. It was \\nhis five whores back from the Franklin Arms salt mines. \\n\\nI thought as I walked to the Ford, “How about it? Those five whores are \\nprobably checking in a coupla grand for a night’s work. Why couldn’t it be \\nme up there in that crazy pad with my mitt out for all those frog skins?” \\n\\nThe night people had vanished from the street. Knots of squares on the \\nway to work bunched at the street-car stops. I got in the Ford and U-turned \\ntoward the Haven. \\n\\nI saw an all-night drug store and pulled into the parking lot. I copped a \\nsaw-buck pair of binoculars, and at the drug counter, I got the insulin and \\ncopped spikes and eyedroppers. Five minutes later I got to the Haven. I \\nparked on the street. \\n\\nI glanced up at our apartment window. I saw the drapes flutter. I got a flash \\nof the runt’s dark face pulling back. I walked through the lobby to the \\nelevator. The joint sure looked shabby after Top’s joint. \\n\\nI thought as I got on the elevator, “If the runt is shitty and tries to third \\ndegree me this morning I’ll bury my foot in her ass.” \\n\\nI got off on the fourth floor. I walked down the hall to four-twenty. I slid \\n\\n\\n\\nthe rubber bands off the top of the tobacco can. I opened the top and took my \\npacket of girl out. It was wrapped in tin foil inside a penny balloon. I shoved \\nit into my watch pocket. I took a yellow from the top of the loose reefer and \\ndry-swallowed it. \\n\\nI knocked on the door. I waited a full minute. I knocked again, harder. \\nFinally the runt opened it. She was stretching and massaging her eyes with \\nher fists, conning me she had been fast asleep. She jumped into bed. She \\nturned her back and pulled the covers to her ears. \\n\\nI put the can of reefer on the dresser. I saw a tiny pile of bills on it. I heeled \\nthem apart. It was only forty slats. I went to the closet and checked the toes of \\nthe tan Stetsons. Empty! I stashed the binoculars in a coat pocket with my C \\nand bang outfit I saw smoke spiraling from a cigarette lying on the base of \\nthe plaster copy of “The Kiss” near the front window. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, what did you do, break your leg or knock off as soon as you \\nsaw me split? Is this tonight’s take? Turn over so I can see that black mug of \\nyours.” \\n\\nI was standing at the side of the bed. My right hand was resting on the \\nclosed plastic lid of the record player. The tips of my fingers were touching \\nthe back of it near the motor. It was warm. I raised the lid. Lady Day’s \\nwhimper about that “mean man” was on the turntable. The runt turned \\nslowly. I looked down into her face. Her eyes were narrow. Her jib was \\npuffed out. She and Lady Day had been dragging me through the mud all \\nnight. The whore was acting like an outraged housewife. \\n\\nShe said, “Ain’t I never going to be nothing but a bitch to you? Call me \\nPhyllis the whore, or Runt the fool. You’d never believe it but I’m human. \\nThat scratch I made tonight ain’t bad. These streets are new to me. I gotta feel \\nmy way and get hip to the tricks.” \\n\\nThat cocaine was blowing a frosty blizzard through my skull. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, when your funky black ass is in the grave you’ll still be a \\nbitch; Bitch, one of these nights you’re going to shoot your jib off. I’ll curtsy \\nand call you Runt the corpse. You stinking bitch I’m hip you’re human. \\nYou’re a human black slop-bucket for those peckerwood swipes. \\n\\n“You gutless idiot. I’m going to throw you out that window if you don’t \\nget the kinks outta your ass an hustle some real scratch. Don’t get hip to the \\ntricks. Bitch. Get hip to what I’m rapping. If you don’t stop your bullshit, I’m \\ngonna kick your heart out and stomp on it. Now don’t crack your jib unless I \\nrap to you. Bitch.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI started to take my clothes off. She just lay there staring at me. Her eyes \\nwere gleaming like a crazy Voodoo Doctor’s. I got into bed. I turned my back \\nto her. I could feel the freak inching toward me. \\n\\nShe stroked the back of my neck. I felt the hot tip of the lizard on the back \\nof my neck. I felt the scab on her brow scrape the tip of my ear. I pulled away \\ntoward the edge of the bed. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I’m sorry I bugged you. I love you. Please forgive me.” \\n\\nThe bed creaked when I rattlesnaked to strike. I hooked my right heel \\nunder the bed springs. I raised myself on my right elbow. I drew my “ved” \\nleft arm back so the back of my left fist touched my right cheek. I grunted for \\nvelocity and blackjacked my left elbow into her gut-button. She groaned and \\nwrapped and unwrapped her legs. She chattered her teeth like she was \\nfreezing to death. \\n\\nI could feel that yellow drawing a heavy black curtain inside my dome. \\nJust before I went under I thought, “I wonder if the runt can lug a hundred \\nand fifty pounds to that window.” \\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\nMELODY OFF KEY \\n\\n\\nThe blast of the phone woke me. The pad was dark as hell. I flung my left \\nhand out for the runt. She wasn’t there. I fumbled the receiver to my ear. \\n\\nI said, “Hello, this is Mary’s brother.” \\n\\nHe said, “I wanta speak to Mary. Put her on, yeah?” \\n\\nI said, “She just went out. She’s taking a walk.” \\n\\nHe hung up. I cradled the phone on the bedside table. I switched the table \\nlamp on. I checked Mickey. It was seven-thirty p.m. I wondered if I had \\nblown the runt. \\n\\nI got up and checked the closet. Her clothes were still there. I went to the \\ndresser. I checked the forty slats. Two were missing. There was a note beside \\nthe scratch. \\n\\nIt read, “Daddy, I took a deuce for the street. I’m gonna hump my ass off. \\nPlease try to be a little sweet to your little bitch dog, huh?” \\n\\nI thought, “I’m stumbling upon some pimp answers. It looks like the \\ntougher a stud is the more a whore goes for him. I’ll sure be glad when those \\nfour days pass and I go with Top to the Sweet cut in. I gotta watch that the \\nrunt don’t get hip I’m banging stuff. Gee, I’m starved. I gotta eat before I \\nbang some girl.” \\n\\nI went to the phone. The broad who should have been a wrestler picked up. \\n\\nI said, “Anybody down there to get me bacon and eggs?” \\n\\nShe said, “Wait a second, I’ll let you talk to Silas, the elevator man.” \\n\\nThe old Maggie and Jiggs fan said, “Yeah, Big Timer, what is it?” \\n\\nI said, “Silas, can I get bacon with eggs over light, and toast?” \\n\\nHe said, “Yeah, there’s a greasy spoon right across the street I’m going \\nnow.” \\n\\nI hung up and went to the closet. I got the spy piece. I went to the window. \\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the old jink hobble across the street toward the Busy Bee Cafe. \\n\\nI made a sweep up and down the street to spot the runt. I didn’t see her. I \\nzeroed the spy into the greasy joint. The runt was draining a cup of coffee at \\nthe counter. She came out. Her eyes flashed whitely up at our window. \\n\\nShe walked down the street twisting her rear end at the passing cars. I saw \\nher round black ass hook a white trick in a black Hog. He skidded to the curb. \\nShe got in. I wondered if it was the same joker that called. \\n\\nI ducked into the shower. I was toweling off when I heard a rap on the \\ndoor. I saronged the towel. On the way to the door I scooped the can of \\ngangster off the dresser and stuck it behind the mirror. \\n\\nI heard Silas outside the door whistling “When the Saints Go Marching \\nIn.” I opened the door. He had a tray in his hands. I took it. A paper napkin \\nfluttered to the floor. He stooped for it. \\n\\nI looked into the big brown eyes of a pretty yellow broad coming out of the \\ndoor across the hall. The scar-faced stud who tooted at the Roost had walked \\nout in front of her. He had a saxophone case under his arm. She rolled her \\nlustrous eyes at me. They rocketed to that lump on the sarong. Her sly hot \\nsmile made a flat statement, “Please, try it for size.” \\n\\nI skull noted her. Silas finally tore his eyes from her rear end floating down \\nthe hall. He had squeezed the paper napkin into a damp ball. \\n\\nHe said, “That’s a buck.” \\n\\nI put the tray on the dresser. I took three slats to the door and gave them to \\nhim. \\n\\nI said, “Silas, that’s quite a package with Mr. Hyde. Give me a rundown, \\nhuh?” \\n\\nHe said, “Yeah, she’s stacked tough enough to make a preacher lay his \\nBible down. The horn blower ain’t had her but a coupla years. She’s done \\nrammed her cat scent up his nose and got him hooked. She was a whore until \\nhe squared her up. \\n\\n“He’s got it bad. He don’t allow her outta his sight. Any club he plays she \\nhasta be right there stuck in his ass. If I was thirty years younger I’d steal her. \\n\\n“Thanks, Big Timer, for the deuce. Any time you want something, call old \\nSilas. Sit the tray outside your door when you finish.” \\n\\nI sat on the side of the bed and wolfed down the bacon and eggs. I felt \\nbetter. I wanted to feel wonderful. I put together everything for bang time. I \\nheld the end of a necktie in my teeth. I coiled it and tightened it around my \\narm. On first stab I hit a perfect bullseye. I did Top’s jackoff bit. I threw up. I \\n\\n\\n\\njust made it to the john. The kick was greater than the one at Top’s. \\n\\nI thought, “What if my black face like magic turned white. Shit, I could go \\nout that hotel front door and sneak through the barbedwire stockade. I’d be \\nlike a wolf turned loose on a flock of sheep. That white world wouldn’t \\ntumble that I’m a Nigger. I could pay ’em all back in spades, the Dummy, the \\nWhite Bull, that bastard judge that crucified me on my first rap. Once I \\nescape this black hell I’ll find a way all right. Well Nigger, you’re pretty, but \\na bleach cream will never be invented that will make you white. So, pimp \\nyour ass off and be somebody with what you got. It could be worse, you \\ncould be an ugly Nigger.” \\n\\nI dressed and powdered my face. That sure was one pretty sonuvabitch in \\nthat mirror. I saw a roach scouting the tray’s rim. I shoved the tray out into \\nthe hall. \\n\\nI thought, “I gotta start stalking that fine bitch across the hall. Maybe I’ll \\ndecoy the runt to get past that scarfaced watchdog. I guess I’ll take a walk. \\nMaybe I can cop my second whore. I feel hard and lucky as a horseshoe.” \\n\\nI put the can of reefer and the other sizzle into a paper bag. I locked the \\ndoor and went down the hall toward the elevator. On the way, I stopped at the \\nporter’s broom closet. It was unlocked. I tiptoed and shoved the bag of sizzle \\nbehind some junk on a shelf. \\n\\nThe cocaine had me froggy. I saw the floor indicator stop at floor number \\ntwo. I took the stairway to the lobby. I dropped the key on the desk and \\nglided to the street. The cocaine had fitted wings on my feet. I felt cool, \\nbreathless, and magnificent. It was a balmy eighty degrees. I was glad I’d left \\nthe benny. \\n\\nI walked toward a rainbow bouquet of neon maybe ten blocks away. My \\nsenses screamed on the razor-edge of cocaine. It was like walking through a \\nbattlefield. The streaking headlights of the car arcing the night were giant \\ntracer bullets. The rattling crashing street-cars were army tanks. The \\nfrightened, hopeless black faces of the passengers peered through the grimy \\nwindows. They were battleshocked soldiers doomed forever to the front \\ntrenches. \\n\\nI passed beneath an El-train bridge. A terrified, glowing face loomed \\ntoward me in the tunnel’s gloom. It was an elderly white man trapped behind \\nenemy lines. A train furled by overhead. It bombed and strafed the street. The \\nshrapnel fell in gritty clouds. \\n\\nI was too nervous for the combat zone. I whistled at a general in a yellow \\n\\n\\n\\nstaff car to halt. He whisked me to that oasis of neon. It turned out he was a \\nmercenary. He shafted me a slat and a quarter for the evacuation. \\n\\nI got out and mothed toward a Haggling flash. The “Fun House.” It was a \\nbar. I opened the door and stepped inside. It almost busted the gaskets in my \\nbowels. A phosphorescent green skeleton popped up out of the floor in front \\nof me. It screeched a hollow howl and then dived back into the floor through \\na trap door. \\n\\nI just stood there shaking. I couldn’t figure why those crazy jokers at the \\nbar were yukking like pickaninnys. To stay with the program I mastered a \\nKing Fish grin. I went to the bar and sat between “Amos” and “Andy.” \\n\\nI saw a tall stud with a Frankenstein mask on behind the log. He darted his \\nhand in a sneaky way under the log. There was a wooshing noise like a tire \\ngoing flat. My stool descended beneath me. I looked up at Amos. My nose \\nwas an inch from the log. Amos was grinning down at me. \\n\\nAmos said, “You sho nuff ain’t been here befo, is you Slim? You frum de \\nbig-foot country?” \\n\\nAndy said, “Wait til he ketch his win. He gonna buy us a pitchuh suds. We \\ngonna lurn ole home boy bout dis big city rigamaro.” \\n\\nEverybody at the crowded log yukked in a deep South accent. Frankenstein \\npushed his mercy button. I felt the stool stretching up. With the cocaine \\nkangarooing me, and this booby-trapped nest of low-life suckers I stumbled \\ninto I had more than a frantic yearning for maybe four-twenty at the Haven. \\n\\nHe walked down the log to me. \\n\\nHe said, “It’s all in fun. Welcome to the ‘Fun House.’ What’ll it be?” \\n\\nI ignored him. I got off the stool. I looked down at it. Its metal legs were \\ntubular and anchored to the floor. It had to be a compressed air gizmo. I \\nstepped back and looked at the two ex-cotton pickers. I twitched my nose. I \\nlooked down and around them, then the length of the log. I fingered the \\nbutton on that sling shot in my raise. \\n\\nI said, “King Fished, Holy mackul, boys. You smell dat? I’se wunder iffen \\nsome po stupid Nigger’s funky-ass, nappy-head Southern Mammy ain’t dose \\nshit out anuther square-ass, ugly bastard turd?” \\n\\nAmos and Andy dropped their jibs like plantation idiots. They shot an \\nanguished look at the white joker behind the log. I walked out the door. They \\ndidn’t dig my humor. Maybe it was too “in.” \\n\\nI slammed into a perfumed line-backer. In reflex, I threw my arms around \\nher soft shoulders. She had the flawless face of Olivia de Haviland. She was \\n\\n\\n\\nbigger and prettier. I felt the fabric of her tailored black suit petal stroke \\nacross my fingertips. She was the finest broad I’d seen since my last movie. I \\nwondered if she was a whore. I decided to hit on her. \\n\\nI said, “I’m sorry. Ain’t it a bitch, baby the first time we meet it had to be \\nin a collision like two-square? Sugar, were you going into this tramp joint? \\nBelieve me there’s no action inside for a package like you. I just stopped in to \\nmake a call. My name is Blood. What’s yours?” \\n\\nHer big curvy legs were wide tracked. I saw the fabulous shadow of her \\nrear end on the sidewalk. Through the filmy orange blouse I saw a pink mole \\non her milk-white midriff. She brushed back a wayward lock of silky black \\nhair from one of the big electric blue eyes. Her even choppers gleamed like \\nrare china. Her crimson tongue doodled across the cupid bow lips. She was \\ndoing a bit that would have shook up a eunuch. \\n\\nShe said, “Blood! How quaint. Your idiom is fascinating. My name is \\nMelody. I don’t drink in bars. Occasionally I go to a supper club. I am not \\nlooking for action. As a matter of fact my car is disabled. I was going inside \\nto call for help when our heavenly bodies collided. Is it possible that you’re \\nnot oblivious to the esoteric aspects of car repair? Mine is there at the curb.” \\n\\nMy eyes followed her manicured finger to the sparkling new Lincoln \\nsedan. Everything about her hollered class and affluence. \\n\\nI thought, “This beautiful white bitch has class. She sounds like an \\negghead. With wheels like that she’s probably got a bundle in the darner! \\nMaybe she’s got some rich sucker in her web. I’ll nut roll on her. I’ll stay \\noutta the pimp role until I case her. I’ll go Sweet William on her. Maybe I can \\nstring her out and get all that scratch she’s got, then make a whore outta her. \\nWith her rear end, this bitch is sitting on a mint.” \\n\\nI said, “Darling, I’m not a mechanic. I did learn a little about cars from a \\nbuddy in a prep school I just finished. You get in. I’ll raise the hood and have \\na look.” \\n\\nShe got in. I raised the hood. I spotted the trouble right away. A battery \\ncable had jarred loose. I put it back on. I looked around the hood and signaled \\nfor the starter try. She did and smiled happily when the engine throbbed to \\nlife. She waved me to her. I stuck my head through the open window. \\n\\nShe said, “Are you driving? If not I should love to take you wherever you \\nwant to go.” \\n\\nI said, “Honey, I’m not driving and it’s a long sad story. You don’t want to \\nhear my troubles. If you drop me off at some nice bar, I promise not to bore \\n\\n\\n\\nyou with it.” \\n\\nI got in. She pulled out into traffic. We cruised along. For two minutes we \\nwere silent. I was busy trying to think of the opener for that long sad story. I \\nhad read a cellhouse full of books. I knew I could rise to a smooth pitch. That \\nold philosopher convict had told me I should forget the pimp game and be a \\ncon man. \\n\\nI said, “Melody, doesn’t fate puppeteer humans in a weird way? There I \\nwas coming out of that joint, I had just called a garage a hundred miles away. \\nThe engine of my car burnt up on my way here from Saint Louis a week ago. \\nI was depressed, lonely, and hopeless in a big, friendless city. \\n\\n“The mechanic had just dropped the bad news. The charge to get the car is \\na hundred and fifty dollars. I have fifty. I was blind with worry when I came \\nout that door. \\n\\n“My elderly mother has to have a pancreas operation. I came here to work \\nfor a contractor in the suburbs. I’m a talented carpenter. I need my car to get \\nto work. I’m committed to start work the first of next week. Mama’s going to \\ndie sure as the sun rises in the East unless I get that money for her operation. \\n\\n“The strange wonderful thing is. Darling, with all these problems I feel so \\ngood. See those garbage cans glittering between the tenements? To me they \\nare giant jewels. I want to climb up on those rooftops and cry out to the stars, \\nI have met, I have found the beautiful Melody. Surely I’m the luckiest black \\nman alive. Convince me you’re real. Don’t evaporate like a beautiful mirage. \\nI’d die if you did.” \\n\\nOut of the side scope in my eye I saw those awesome thighs quivering. She \\nalmost crashed the Lincoln into the rear end of the gray Studebaker ahead of \\nus. \\n\\nShe cut in sharply and grated the Lincoln’s wheels against the curb. She \\nshut the motor off and turned toward me. Her eyes were blue bonfires of \\npassion. The pulse on the satin throat was maniacing. She slid close to me. \\nShe zippered her scarlet mouth to mine. That confection tongue flooded my \\nmouth with sugar. Her nails dug into my thighs. She gazed at me. \\n\\nShe said, “Blood, you sweet black poetic panther. Does that prove I’m real. \\nNo, I know I don’t want to evaporate, ever. Please, let’s don’t go to a bar. \\nYou can’t solve your problems with alcohol. My parents are out of the city \\nuntil tomorrow noon. Settle for coffee and conversation at my place. Will you \\nBlood? Perhaps we can find solutions to your problems there. Besides, I’m \\nexpecting Mother to call me at home later this evening.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “Angel of mercy. I’m putting myself in your tender hands.” \\n\\nShe lived a long way from the black concentration camp. She drove for \\nalmost an hour. I could smell the pungent odors of early April plant life. This \\nwhite world was like leaving Hell and riding through Heaven. The neat rows \\nof plush houses shone in the moonlight. The streets were quiet as maybe the \\nCathedral in Rheims. \\n\\nI thought, “Ain’t it a bitch? Ninety-eight percent of the black people back \\nthere in Hell will be born and die and never know the joys of this earthly \\nHeaven. There ain’t but two passports the white folks honor. A white skin, or \\na bale of scratch. I sure got to pimp good and cop my scratch passport. Well, \\nat least I get a Cinderella crack at Heaven. This is good. It’s hipping me to \\nwhat I’m missing.” \\n\\nWe turned into her driveway. I saw the soft glow of a table lamp behind \\nblue drapes in the front room. She parked the Lincoln in a pink stucco garage \\nthat matched the house. The garage was connected to the house. We went \\nthrough the back door. We passed through the kitchen. Even in the dimness it \\nsparkled. We moved like burglars through the half-darkened house. We \\nwalked on deep-pile carpet up a stairway. We got to the top. She stopped. \\n\\nShe whispered, “Blood, I was born in this house. Everybody in the block \\nknows me. If some friend passed and knew someone was at home, we might \\nget an unwelcome visitor. We’ll go to my bedroom in the rear.” \\n\\nI followed to her bedroom. She flipped on a tiny blue light over a mirrored \\ndressing table. The bedroom was done in pale blue and off-white. The queen¬ \\nsized bed had a blue satin canopy over it. I sat down on a white silk chaise \\nnext to the dressing table. She switched on an ivory radio. Debussy’s “Clare \\nde Lune” sweet-noted gently through the room. \\n\\nShe kicked off her tiny black calfskin shoes. She was even more beautiful \\nhere than she had been in the street. She stroked my ear lobes with her \\nfingertips. \\n\\nShe said, “Mommy’s pretty black panther don’t run away now. I’m going \\ndownstairs and make coffee.” \\n\\nShe went down the stairs. \\n\\nI thought, “I’m gonna crack on her for scratch. She should be good for a C \\nnote at least. A C note ain’t bad to break the ice with. If she springs for it, I’ll \\ntie her to that bed and put my Pepper-specialty on her. It’s certain to flip a \\nyoung broad like her who’s lived in Heaven all her life! Besides, I ain’t never \\nsloughed around in a bed with a canopy. Especially one in Heaven.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI heard the faint bounce of her tiny feet on the stairway. She came into the \\nbedroom with a silver service. We were going to have coffee in style. She set \\nthe gleaming tray on the dressing-table top. \\n\\nShe said, “Blood, pour us a cup. I’m going to get out of these clothes. Then \\nwe can chat.” \\n\\nI poured two and left them black. I sipped mine. She stepped into a walk-in \\ncloset. She stepped out a moment later. All she had on were black panties and \\nthe red top of a transparent shortie nightgown. Her small, but sculptured \\nbosom straight-jutted against the red gauze. She sat on the foot of the bed \\nfacing me and crossed her legs. I handed her the cup of black. \\n\\nShe said, “So, you’re going to stay in town for a while?” \\n\\nI said, “Baby, if I get strong enough encouragement I’ll stay all my life. \\nBaby, it’s a pity I had to meet you when I’m in bad shape. I want to be good \\ncompany, but that car problem and Mama won’t let my mind stay on a \\npleasant track.” \\n\\nHer ringers snapped “eureka.” \\n\\nShe got off the bed and went to the dresser across the room. She opened \\nthe top drawer and took out a bankbook. She came back and sat on the bed. \\nShe tapped the red nail of her left index finger against her white teeth. She \\nstudied the book’s figures. I saw a frown hedgerow her brow. She got up and \\nwent to the dresser and threw the book into the open drawer and banged it \\nshut. \\n\\nI thought, “This broad has over-drawn. She’s gonna try the check con on \\nme.” \\n\\nShe stooped and opened the bottom drawer. She brought out a foot-long, \\nfoot-tall metal pig. She walked to the dressing table and put the porker on the \\ntable beside me. \\n\\nShe said, “Blood, this is the best I can do to help you now. I don’t get my \\nallowance for a week. I have less than a hundred dollars in my account. \\nCheer up, there must be at least a hundred dollars in quarters and halves in \\nthis bank. Believe me, I can vividly imagine what it’s like to be colored and \\nfaced with your problems. Let’s say it’s a loan.” \\n\\nI hefted the poker for a moment to check its gross weight. It was heavy all \\nright. It felt a C note heavy. I reached out and took her hand. I guided her to \\nmy side on the chaise. I put my arms around her. I kissed her and sucked at \\nthat sugary tongue like a suicidal diabetic. I leaned back from her. I looked \\ninto the heart of the blue fire. \\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “Baby, it’s a wonderful secret that you’ve discovered. Not many \\npeople know it’s better to give than to receive. Maybe it sounds crazy, but I \\nwish you weren’t so beautiful and generous, so perfect. I don’t see how you \\ncan miss capturing my foolish heart. You’re a cinch to make me yours \\nforever. Baby, I’m just a poor black country boy. Please don’t hurt my heart.” \\n\\nShe sure had an appetite for the Jeff con. The blue fire softened. Her eyes \\nwere misty and serious. She held my head between her dove-soft palms. \\n\\nShe said, “Blood baby. I’m white, but I have been more unhappy than any \\nblack person all my life. My parents have never understood me. When my \\nwhole being cried out for love and understanding, they gave me shiny things \\nto stop my tears. \\n\\n“Non-whites are like dirt to them. They are narrow and cold. If they found \\nout you had been here they would disown me before they dropped dead. \\nThere’s a sweet warmth that you have. I know that you can make me happy. I \\nam so desperate for love and understanding. Please give it to me.” \\n\\nI said, “Baby, you can dump all your money on the black horse to win. I’m \\ngonna win ’em all for you, beautiful.” \\n\\nShe said, “Blood, you’re a black panther; I’m a white lamb. I know \\nnothing can stop that panther from taking the lamb, soul and body. The lamb \\nwill bide her time to take the panther. The lamb needs and wants it that way. \\nNow listen carefully and please catch the clue of my tragedy so nothing will \\nshock you in my bed. \\n\\n“Blood, perhaps you are aware of the structural flaws built into the \\ncolumns of the world’s most famous building. It’s the Parthenon. The flaw is \\ncalled entasis. This contrived flaw is necessary so that the fickle human eye \\nsees only perfection. I am a lot like those columns. I am not old, but I am \\nbeautiful. My tragedy is that unlike the entasis that gives perfection to the \\ncolumns, my entasis must be concealed to protect my perfection. Can you \\nunderstand?” \\n\\nI thought, “What the hell, so this broad’s got a prematurely-gray cat. \\nMaybe it’s a little off-center. If it’s odd it will be a novelty kick for me. She’s \\nso beautiful the tricks won’t notice a tiny irregularity after I’ve turned her \\nout.” \\n\\nI said, “Baby Melody, you haven’t opened the door to a square. As fine as \\nyou are I wish you had two heads. Now get on that bed on your back. I’m \\ngonna make love to you black panther style. You got some long towels?” \\n\\nShe went to the hall linen closet. She gave me four long slender ones. She \\n\\n\\n\\nslipped off the red top and panties. She lay on her back in bed. I saw her flaw. \\nWas this her entasis? I saw no crotch hair. She looked completely bald \\ndownstairs. I tied both her legs to the posts at the foot of the bed. I tied her \\nleft arm to a post at the head. The phone jangled on a nightstand at her side. \\nShe picked up the receiver with her free right hand. \\n\\nShe said, “Hi Mother, I’m fine. Are you and Dad still having fun? Mother, \\nI miss you both so terribly. Are you coming home tomorrow as planned? Oh \\ngood. I’ll be at the airport on time. I’ve gone to bed. I’ve gotten out that \\n‘Anthology of Africa.’ I’m going to have a wild time researching the Watusi \\nWarrior. Good night. Mother. Oh, tell Dad to bring me some of that heavenly \\nMiami beach wear. I’ll be a sensation here on the beach this summer.” \\n\\nI had taken my clothes off when she hung up. I lashed her free arm to the \\nfourth bedpost. I looked down at her. Her eyes were pleading. \\n\\nShe said, “Remember Blood darling, you are not an unsophisticated \\nbumpkin. You are not prone to shock states. I know you are going to find my \\nentasis as sweet and desirable as the rest of me.” \\n\\nI wondered why she still worried about her entasis. She knew I saw she \\nwas hairless downstairs. I put my knee on the bed. I stroked her belly. I felt \\ncloth. I took a close look. A custom flesh-colored jock belt bandied her \\ncrotch. I ripped the elastic top down over her round hips. I jumped back. My \\nrear end bounced on the floor. I struggled to my feet. \\n\\nI shouted, “You stinking sissy sonuvabitch!” \\n\\nHis real entasis had popped up pink and stiff. It was a foot long and as \\nthick as the head of a cobra. \\n\\nHe was crying like I had put a lighted match to his entasis. \\n\\nHe sobbed, “You promised to understand. Please, Blood, keep your \\npromise. You don’t know what you’re missing. It’s delicious you fool.” \\n\\nI said, “Look man, I made my promises to a broad, not a stud. I’m a pimp, \\nnot a faggot. I’m getting the hell out of here. I’m charging you the porker for \\nmy time and your bullshit.” \\n\\nHe lay there blubbering. I speed dressed. I took the porker off the table and \\nstuck it under my arm. I walked toward the stairway. I looked back. His \\nbeautiful face was ugly in anger and hate. \\n\\nHe screamed, “You dirty Nigger liar, thief! Untie me you Coon Bastard! \\nOh, how I wish I had your black ass tied here on your belly!” \\n\\nI said, “Man, as slick as you are you’ll untie yourself before long. Yeah, \\nthat entasis could murder me all right.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI walked down the stairway. I went through the house to the back door. I \\nwalked down the driveway to the street. I walked for an hour before I got out \\nof the residential sprawl. I was lucky to hail a Yellow Cab as soon as I got to \\na busy intersection. \\n\\nWhen it got me to the Haven, the meter read fourteen-thirty. I gave the \\ncabbie a fin and a saw buck. I looked up at my window. The runt was at it. It \\nwas two a.m. It had been like a nightmare Halloween all the way. All trick \\nand no treat. I was icy sober. \\n\\nThen it struck me riding up on the elevator. That white faggot could cross \\nme. What if he couldn’t free himself by the time his folks got home? He was \\na cinch to cover himself. He’d say a Nigger burglar or holdup man had \\nrobbed him and trussed him up. \\n\\nI was a two-time loser. Five to ten would stick to me like flypaper. Even if \\nhe untied himself right away he might be mad enough to frame me. I \\nremembered the Dalanski-Pepper cross. I was sweating salt balls when I \\nretrieved my stash in the broom closet. \\n\\nI went to my watch pocket with the cocaine. I knocked on fourtwenty. The \\nrunt opened the door. She was grinning. \\n\\nShe said, “Hello, Daddy-angel. Your dog bitch bumped her black ass off \\ntonight. Gotta piggy bank, huh?” \\n\\nI said, “So whatta you want, bitch, a medal for doing your whore duty?” \\n\\nI didn’t answer her question. I looked down to see if she’d sprouted an \\nentasis. She was buck-naked. I stepped inside and bolted the door. There \\nwere seventy slats on the dresser. I turned and lowered my face. She kissed \\nme. I put the porker on the base of the “Kiss” statue. \\n\\nI gave her the can of grass. She sat on the bed. She shook some grass out of \\nthe can onto a newspaper in her lap. She started rolling a joint. I took my \\nclothes off. I went into the bathroom to shower and scrub the sissy taste out \\nof my jib. The piercing heavy odor of the gangster wafted to me. \\n\\nOver the roar of the shower I shouted, “Girl, there’s a gap under that \\nslammer. Chink it up with a rag or something. Torch a coupla sticks of \\nincense.” \\n\\nI came out of the bathroom and got into bed beside her. She handed me a \\njoint. I lit it and sucked it into a roach. I squeezed tobacco from the tip of a \\ncigarette. I stuck the butt of gangster into the empty tip. I twisted the end and \\nlit it. It was a good reefer. \\n\\nI could feel my skull go into a dreamy float. I got one brilliant thought \\n\\n\\n\\nafter another. The trouble was, each one I tried to hold long enough so I could \\nput a saddle on it stampeded. It was maybe like the painful irritation a drunk \\nwrangler suffers trying to corral a herd of greased mustangs. \\n\\nGangster was sure a whore’s high. That reefer confusion was no good for a \\npimp’s skull. That beautiful sissy had buried a hot seed in my guts. The wild \\nflower blossomed. I dreamily drifted into the runt. I rolled sleepily out of the \\nwarm churning tunnel. I wouldn’t need a yellow tonight. \\n\\n\\n\\n8 \\n\\nGRINNING SLIM \\n\\n\\nI opened my eyes. I saw glinting stars of dust whirling like a golden \\nhurricane through a bright shaft of noon sun. I looked through the open \\nbedroom door. I saw the runt sitting at the living room window. She was \\ndoing her nails. She lifted her eyes from her nails. She looked into the \\nbedroom. \\n\\nI said, “Good morning, li’l freak puppy. I’m gonna call Silas to run across \\nthe street for ham and eggs. Are you hungry?” \\n\\nShe said, “Yeah, I’m hungry, but the way he moves around it would take \\nhim a week to cop. I’ll slip on something and go myself.” \\n\\nShe went to the closet and slipped on her blue poplin rain-orshine coat. She \\ntook a fin off the dresser and held it up for my consent. I nodded my head. I \\nheard the door shut when she went out. \\n\\nI lit a cigarette. I thought, “I wonder if Melody has the heat looking for me. \\nI’ve only got a day or so left before Glass Top takes me to Sweet Jones. I’m \\ngonna cool it. I won’t go out at all. I’ll stay right here in the hotel until Top \\ncalls me.” \\n\\nThe phone rang just as the runt came through the bedroom door. She put \\nthe plates wrapped in wax paper on the dresser. She picked up the receiver. I \\ngot up, took my plate and started to eat with a plastic fork. \\n\\nShe said, “Hello. Oh, Chuck, how are you, sweetie? I was just thinking \\nabout you, lover. No, I can’t. I wish I could come out for a few drinks, but \\nmy brother won’t be home from work until six. Mama’s not well at all. I have \\nto stay here during the day to take care of her. I could slip out around seven. \\nYeah, I could do that until eight for twenty. Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes.” \\n\\nShe hung up the phone and her coat. She sat naked on the side of the bed \\neating. \\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I got an idea for that cat of yours. You gotta take a stiff \\nbrush and brush the hair straight down every time you think about it. Put \\nsome hair grower on it until you got maybe a four-inch cone. Your tricks will \\npant to bury their beaks in it. It will make your cat unique with that extra \\ndimension.” \\n\\nShe mumbled, “Where on Earth did you get a jazzy idea like that?” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, ain’t you hip yet? I’m a pimp with great imagination, that’s \\nall.” \\n\\nShe finished her flapjacks. She got up and gathered up an armful of our \\nsoiled clothing. She went into the bathroom. I heard the water sloshing in the \\nbowl. She was doing our laundry. I turned my back to the sunlight. I felt old \\nMorpheus slugging his velvet hammer against my eyelids. \\n\\nI woke up in darkness. I looked at the front-room window. The streetlights \\nwere on. I turned the nightstand lamp on. Mickey said seven-ten. The runt \\nwas gone. She was breaking her luck with Chuck. \\n\\nI thought, “Jesus, I sure needed rest all right. That fast track I’ve been \\nblundering on sure took the juice out of me.” \\n\\nI got up and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. I had made several \\nbrush strokes when the phone rang. I picked it up. He rapped before I could \\nopen my mouth. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, this is Glass Top. The plans have changed. I’m in a hurry. \\nBe outside your joint in fifteen minutes. You got that?” \\n\\nI said, “Yeah, but...” \\n\\nHe had hung up. I dressed even faster than I had at the sissy’s pad. I rushed \\ndown the hall. I stopped at the broom-closet stash. I hurled the sizzle into the \\ncorner on the shelf. I took the stairs three at a time to the lobby. I sailed the \\nkey to the desk top. I bolted out the door. \\n\\nTop was parked in front of the joint in the red Hog. He had his hand over \\nthe horn when he saw me. I got in. The Hog squealed from the curb. Top was \\nsure in a hurry. I could hear the harsh whisper of the Hog’s tires against the \\npavement. We passed that neon bouquet. I looked back and saw the “Fun \\nHouse” sign flashing. I wondered if Melody was out here somewhere booby \\ntrapping with his entasis. \\n\\nI said, “Jack, I didn’t expect your call for a coupla days. What happened?” \\n\\nHe said, “There’s a big boxing match tonight. All the biggest pimps and \\nwhores in the country are gonna be at Sweet’s after the fight. Kinda like a \\nparty. All of ’em use stuff. Even with Sweet as the middleman I should take \\n\\n\\n\\noff a coupla grand for my end.” \\n\\n“Sweet never goes to fights. He can’t stand big crowds, and besides they \\nwon’t let Miss Peaches into fights. Sweet’s gnawing his nails waiting for this \\nstuff. He ain’t got none for himself and he’s anxious to cop some stuff for \\nthose birds coming from the fight.” \\n\\nI said, “Have you cracked anything about me to him?” \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, you ain’t hip I’m a genius? He called and I rapped to him \\nthis morning. I played you off as my punk nephew from Kansas City. You \\ngot wild ideas you wanta be a pimp. I’ve tried to chill you back to K.C. to \\nmaybe hustle pool or even be a broom mechanic. You’re a stupid, stubborn \\npunk. I’ve told you a thousand times you ain’t got it to pimp. You gotta pimp. \\n\\n“You would eat ten yards of Sweet’s crap. You think he’s God. You won’t \\nbelieve your uncle is tight with God. I’m Glass Top. I gotta save face even \\nfor a snot-nosed punk. Maybe if you hang around the inside of the fast track \\nfor a hot minute you’ll get scared. You’ll wise up, get outta my ass and run \\nyour ass back to K.C. Now Kid, don’t shoot your jib off at his pad. If he don’t \\nremember you from the Roost, don’t wake him up.” \\n\\nI said, “Don’t worry Top. I won’t rank us. I’ll never forget you. Pal, for the \\ncut in. That was sure some beautiful stuff you played for Sweet.” \\n\\nHe caressed his patent-leather hair. He erected his wide shoulders inside \\nhis blue mohair jacket. His pretty, bitch face wore that terrible conceit and \\nawful pride maybe of a cute mass murderer who never gets her victims’ \\nblood on her. The full moon through the windshield shone flush on his face. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, you ain’t heard nothing yet. Shit, I done drove three whores \\nscreaming crazy with this brain. They in the boob box upstate right now \\nbabbling about Pretty Glass Top. Even Sweet ain’t shipped but two up there. \\nHe’s been pimping almost twice as long as me.” \\n\\nI said, “Christ, Top, I don’t get it. Why drive a whore nuts if she’s still \\nhumping out the scratch. A stud would have to be slick as grease to plant bats \\nin the skull of a bitch that was sane. I can’t dig how a stud could do it. I ain’t \\nhip to it.” \\n\\nHe said, “Sucker, what you don’t dig, and ain’t hip to would make a book \\nbigger than this Hog. Now you take Sweet, the two he crossed were young \\nwhite broads with small mileage. He’s sick in the head. He’s got an insane \\nhate for the whole white race. \\n\\n“He was a crumb crusher of seven down in Georgia when the white folks \\nfirst poisoned his skull. His mammy was jet black and beautiful. The \\n\\n\\n\\npeckerwoods for miles around were aching to lay her. The son of the wealthy \\nplantation owner that Sweet’s old man sharecropped for way-laid her on the \\nway to a spring. He punched her out, tore her clothes off and socked it into \\nher. She was naked and crying when she got back to her shack. \\n\\n“The peckerwood pig hid out in the woods. Sweet’s old man came in from \\nthe fields and found his wife clawed and bawling. He was close to seven feet \\nand weighed three hundred. Sweet still remembers how his old man hollered \\nand butted his head against the door of the shack. The hinges ripped loose. \\n\\n“He knew the woods like a fox. He found the white boy. He left him for \\ndead. He covered him with brush. He slipped back to his shack. Sweet \\nremembers the white boy’s blood on his old man, even on his old man’s bare \\nfeet. He had stomped the white boy to a red pulp out there in the lonely \\nwoods. The old man figured he was safe. The white folks would never find \\nthe corpse in those thick woods. He cleaned himself, repaired the shack door, \\nand waited. \\n\\n“He hadn’t croaked the white boy. He had only maimed and paralyzed \\nhim. That night a white man out possum hunting with his dogs heard the kid \\nbleating under the brush. He was out of his skull. It was midnight before the \\nkid’s raving made sense to the white folks. \\n\\n“Sweet heard the mob’s horses galloping toward the shack. He hid in the \\nloft just as the crazy gang came through the shack slammer. Sweet peeped \\nthrough a crack and watched them beat his old man’s head bloody. They \\ndragged him outside. Sweet saw the whole mob rape his mother. \\n\\n“Finally all was quiet except for his mother whimpering on the bed. He \\nsneaked out of the loft. Through the open door he saw his old man swinging \\nin the moonlight from a peach tree in front of the shack. \\n\\n“His mammy went to the funny farm. Sweet was taken in by a share¬ \\ncropper on the same plantation. He worked the fields until he got seventeen. \\nHe ran away and caught a freight train North. He was eighteen when he got \\nhis first whore. She was a white girl. He drove her to suicide before he got \\nnineteen. Sweet’s gotta be sixty now.” \\n\\nHe paused. He steered the Hog with one hand. He took a cigarette from his \\njacket pocket. He punched in the dashboard lighter. \\n\\nI thought, “No wonder Sweet’s off his rocker. I wonder why Top really \\ngave me that tight rundown on Sweet?” \\n\\nThe lighter popped. Top lit his cigarette. He sucked hard. He blew out a \\nwhite cloud against the windshield that for an instant blotted out the moon. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe said, “I ain’t insane like Sweet. My skull is clear and cool. I ain’t no \\nmixed-up Southern Nigger. I was born in the North I grew up with white \\nkids. I don’t hate white people or any other people. I ain’t no black brute. I’m \\na pretty brown-skin lover. I love people. \\n\\n“When I was a square, I was even engaged to marry a white girl. Her \\nparents and friends put pressure on her and she chickened out. I guess I loved \\nher. Right after we quit I went to a hospital for my nerves. I ain’t had nothing \\nbut whores since. It’s like I told you when I met you. Sweet’s a Ford and I’m \\na Duesenberg. He’s just an ugly lucky nut.” \\n\\nI said, “But Top you cracked your booby-box score was higher than \\nSweet’s. Those three gibbering bitches upstate sure don’t show no love for \\nwhore people.” \\n\\nHe said, “There you go, fool. A young chump is just like a dumb bitch. He \\ncan’t figure nothing out himself. He’s gotta have a rundown on everything. \\nOf course I drove those whores crazy, but for a sane reason, sucker. \\n\\n“A pimp cops a whore. He cons her maybe if she stays in his corner \\nhumping his pockets fat, at the end of the rainbow she’s got a husband and a \\nsoft easy chair. To hold her beak to the grindstone, he pumps air castles into \\nher skull. \\n\\n“She takes all the stable grief. She humps her ass into a cramp to outshine \\nthe other whores in the family. At first, it’s easy for the bitch to star. As she \\ngets older and uglier her competition gets younger and prettier. \\n\\n“She don’t have to be no brain to wake up there ain’t no easy chair at the \\nend. She gets hip there ain’t never even been a rainbow. She gets larceny in \\nher heart. She bullshits herself that if she can drive all those young pretty \\nwhores away from the pimp that rainbow might come true after all. If it don’t, \\nshe’ll get her revenge anyway. \\n\\n“It’s a violation of the pimp book to quit a whore. A bitch like that is a \\nticking bomb. Every day, her value to the pimp drops to the zero line. She’s \\nold, tired, and dangerous. She can rattle a pimp into goofing his whole game. \\nIf the pimp is a sucker he’ll try to drive her away with his foot in her ass. \\nShe’s almost a cinch to croak him or cross him into the joint. \\n\\n“I’m a genius. I’m hip that after a bitch has had maybe ten-thousand tricks \\ndrill her she ain’t too steady, skullwise. I don’t tip her I’m salty and \\ndisgusted. I talk like a sweet head-shrinker to her. Indeed of air castles, I \\npump her full of H. \\n\\n“Her skull starts to jelly. I’ll be worried as hell about her. I’ll start sneaking \\n\\n\\n\\nslugs of morphine or chloral hydrate into her shots. While she’s out. I’ll \\nmaybe douse her with chicken blood. She comes to. I’ll tell her I brought her \\nin from the street. I tell her I hope you didn’t croak anybody while you were \\nsleepwalking. \\n\\n“I got a thousand ways to drive ’em goofy. That last broad I flipped, I hung \\nher out a fifth floor window. I had given her a jolt of pure cocaine so she’d \\nwake up outside that window. I was holding her by both wrists. Her feet were \\ndangling in the air. She opened her eyes. When she looked down she \\nscreamed like a scared baby. She was screaming when they came to get her. \\nYou see, kid, I’m all business. I ain’t got an ounce of hate in me.” \\n\\nHe had been driving for at least an hour. I had lost track of time and space. \\nI saw no black faces in the streets around us. I saw tall gleaming apartment \\nhouses. Some so tall they seemed welded to the night sky. \\n\\nI said, “Yeah Top, you’re a cold clever stud all right. I’m sure glad you’re \\nyanking my coat. Jesus, Sweet must live in a white neighborhood.” \\n\\nHe said, “Yeah, Kid, he lives just around that next corner, in a penthouse. \\nLike I told you he’s lucky as a shit-house rat. It’s a million-dollar building. \\nThe old white broad that owns it is Sweet’s freak white dog.” \\n\\nI said, “But don’t the white tenants blow the roof because Sweet lives \\nthere?” \\n\\nHe said, “Sweet’s old white broad owns the building, but Sweet runs it. At \\nleast he runs it through a old ex-pimp pal. Sweet stuck him into a pad on the \\nground floor. Patch Eye, the old stud, collects the rents and keeps the porters \\nand other flunkys on their toes. All the tenants are white gamblers and \\nhustlers. Sweet is got the old ex-pimp running book wide open. The action a \\nday just from the tenants runs two or three grand. I’ll say it a thousand times. \\nSweet is a lucky old stud.” \\n\\nHe turned the corner. He eased the Hog into the curb in front of a snow- \\nwhite apartment building. A moss-green canvas canopy ran from the edge of \\nthe curb twenty-five yards to the kleig-lighted fancy front of the building. A \\ngaunt white stud in a green monkey suit was standing in stooped attention at \\nthe curb. We got out. Top walked around the Hog to the doorman. \\n\\nThe doorman said, “Good evening, gentlemen.” \\n\\nTop said, “Hello Jack, do me a favor. When you take my wheels to the \\nback see that it’s parked close to an exit. When I come out I don’t wanna \\nhassle outta there. Here’s a fin, Buster.” \\n\\nThe doorman said, “Thank you. Sir. I’ll relay your wish to Smitty.” \\n\\n\\n\\nWe walked into the green-painted, black-marbled foyer. I was trembling \\nlike maybe a hick virgin on a casting couch. We walked up the half-dozen \\nmarble steps to an almost invisible glass door. \\n\\nA Boston Coffee-colored broad slid it open. We stepped into the green- \\nand-pearl lobby. A tan broad as flashy as a Cotton Club pony sat behind a \\nblond desk. We walked across the quicksand pearl carpet to the front of it. \\nShe flashed two perfect dozen of the thirty-two. Her voice was contralto silk. \\n\\nShe said, “Good evening, may I help you?” \\n\\nTop said, “Stewart and Lancaster to see Mr. Jones.” \\n\\nShe turned to an elderly black broad sitting before a switchboard beside \\nher. \\n\\nShe told her, “Penthouse, Misters Stewart and Lancaster.” \\n\\nThe old broad shifted her earphones from round her wrinkled neck to her \\nhorns. She plugged in and started batting her chops together. After a moment \\nshe nodded to the pony. We got the ivory flash again. \\n\\nThe pony said, “Thank you so much for waiting. Mr. Jones is at home and \\nwill see you.” \\n\\nI followed Top to the elevators. A pretty brown-skin broad in a tight green \\nuniform zipped us to the fifteenth floor. The brass door opened. We stepped \\nout onto a gold-carpeted entrance hall. It was larger than Top’s living room. \\n\\nA skinny Filipino in a gold lame outfit came toward us. He was grinning \\nand bowing his head, his lank hair flopped across his skull like the wings of a \\nwounded raven. The crystal chandelier overhead glittered his gold suit. He \\ntook my lid. He put it on the limb of a mock mother-of-pearl tree. \\n\\nHe said, “Good evening. Follow, please.” \\n\\nWe followed him to the brink of a sunken living room. It was like a \\nPasha’s passion pit. A green light inside the gurgling bowl of a huge fountain \\nbeamed on the vulgar face of a stone woman squatting over it. She was nude \\nand big as a baby elephant. The red light inside her skull blazed, her eyes \\nstaring straight ahead. Her giant hands pressed the tips of her long breasts \\ninto each corner of her wide open mouth. She was peeing serenely and \\nendlessly into the fountain bowl. \\n\\nWe stepped down to the champagne, oriental carpet. Sweet was sitting \\nacross the dim room on a white velour couch. He was wearing a white satin \\nsmoking jacket. He looked like a huge black fly in a bucket of milk. Miss \\nPeaches was curled at his side. She was resting her black spotted head on a \\nsilk turquoise pillow. Sweet was stroking her back. She purred and locked her \\n\\n\\n\\nyellow eyes on us. I got a whiff of her raw animal odor. \\n\\nSweet said, “Sit your black asses down. Sweetheart, you been dangling me. \\nWhat happened? Did that raggedy nickel Hog break down? So this is your \\nsquare country nephew?” \\n\\nTop sat on a couch beside Miss Peaches. I sat in a blue velour chair several \\nyards to the side of Top. Sweet’s gray eyes were flicking up and down me. I \\nwas nervous. I grinned at him. \\n\\nI jerked my eyes away to a large picture on the wall over the couch. A \\nnaked white broad was on her hands and knees. A Great Dane with his red \\ntongue lolling out was astraddle her back. He had his paws hooked under her \\nbreasts. Her blonde head was turned looking back at him. Her blue eyes were \\npopped wide open. \\n\\nTop said, “Man, that Hog ain’t no plane. I got here quick as I could. You \\nknow I don’t play no games on you, Honey.” \\n\\nI said, “Thank you, Mr. Jones, for letting me come up with ‘unc.’” \\n\\nMy voice triggered the Roost memory. He stiffened and glared at me. He \\nsmashed his hooks together. It sounded like pistol shots. Peaches growled and \\nsneered. \\n\\nHe said, “Ain’t you the little shit ball I chased outta the Roost?” \\n\\nI said, “Yeah, I’m one and the same. I want to beg your pardon for making \\nyou salty that night. Maybe I coulda gotten a pass if I had told you I’m your \\npal’s nephew. I ain’t got no sense, Mr. Jones. I took after my idiot father.” \\n\\nSweet said, “Top, this punk ain’t hopeless. He’s silly as a bitch grinning all \\nthe time, but dig how he butters out the con to keep his balls outta the fire. He \\nsure ain’t got no tender dick to turn down my pretty big-ass Mimi. Kid, I love \\nblack boys with the urge to pimp. Ain’t no surer way to amount to something. \\nYour uncle ain’t but a good pimp. I’m the greatest in the world. He wired me \\nhe’s hoping you’ll fold on this track and split back to the sticks. \\n\\n“You got one whore he tells me. You could have the makings. This joint is \\ngoing to be crawling with fast whores in a coupla hours. I’m gonna be \\npinning you. I’m gonna watch how you handle yourself. Maybe I’m gonna \\nmake you my protege. You gotta be icy; understand, Kid, icy, icy? You gotta \\nstop that grinning. Freeze your map and keep it that way. Maybe I’m gonna \\nprove to your half-ass pimp uncle that I can train even a mule to win the \\nKentucky Derby.” \\n\\nTop said, “Shit Honey, you didn’t have to tip him. I’m pulling for his split. \\nI love the kid. I just don’t think he can cut the pimp game. The kid raps good. \\n\\n\\n\\nI ain’t denying it. He should be maybe a Murphy player or even a mitt man. \\nHis ticker ain’t icy enough to pimp on this track.” \\n\\nI thought, “Top’s pad is a pigsty compared to this layout. It looks like I’m \\nin.” \\n\\nSweet said, “Sweetheart, let’s go in a bedroom and cap up and bag that \\nstuff for those jokers. I’m gonna have old Patch Eye come up here and deal it \\noff. I ain’t no dope peddler. I’m a pimp. Kid, you can cool it. Have the \\nFilipino bring you a taste. If you want get it yourself from the bar over there.” \\n\\nThey went around a hand-painted gold silk screen through a doorway. \\nPeaches padded behind them. I saw a bronze bell on a table beside the couch. \\nI decided to get my own taste. I walked across the room to a turquoise bar. I \\nwent behind it. I took a tall crystal glass off the mirrored shelf on the wall. I \\nmixed creme de menthe and bubbly water. \\n\\nI took my green, cool drink and walked toward the floor-to-ceiling glass \\ndoor. I slid it open and stepped up into the patio. I looked up; the April \\nzephyrs were balleting the burnt-orange and pale-green Japanese lanterns. \\nThey danced on glowing jade cords strung high above the lime floor. \\n\\nThe ice-cream-yellow moon seemed close enough to lick. I walked to the \\npearl parapet. I looked out at a brilliant sea of emerald and ruby neon bursting \\npastel skyrockets toward the cobalt blue sky bejeweled with sapphire stars. \\n\\nI thought, “Sweet sure has caught lightning in a thimble. He came out of \\nthe white man’s cotton fields. He’s pimped himself up to this. He’s living \\nhigh in the sky like a black God in heaven with the white people. He ain’t no \\nNigger doctor. He ain’t no hot-sheet Nigger preacher, but he’s here. \\n\\n“He pimped up his scratch passport. That barbed-wire stockade is a million \\nmiles away. I got more education, I’m better looking, and younger than he is. \\nI know I can do it too.” \\n\\nI remembered Henry and how religious he was. Look what happened to \\nhim. I remembered how I used to kneel every night by the side of the bed to \\npray. I really believed in God then. I knew he existed. Now I wasn’t so sure. I \\nguess the first prison rap started to hack away at my belief in him. \\n\\nI often wondered in the cell how, if he existed, he could let the Dummy \\ndestroy Oscar who loved him. I told myself at the time, maybe he’s got \\ncomplicated long-range plans. Maybe even he’s got divine reasons for letting \\nthe white folks butcher black people down South. \\n\\nMaybe some morning about dawn all the black folks will sing Hallelujah! \\nGod’s white board of directors will untie the red tape. God will roll up his \\n\\n\\n\\nsleeves. He’ll smash down the invisible stockades. He’ll kill all the rats in the \\nblack ghettos. Fill all the black bellies and con all the white folks that Niggers \\nare his children, too. \\n\\nNow I couldn’t wait. If he were up there or not, I had to go with the odds. I \\nstared into the sky. It was the first time I’d prayed since Steve, the tramp. I \\nknow now it was more a fearful alibi than anything else. \\n\\nI said, “Lord, if you’re up there, you know I’m black and you know my \\nthoughts. Lord, if the Bible is really your divine book then I know it’s a sin to \\npimp. If you’re up there and listening you know I’m not trying to con you. \\n\\n“Lord, I’m not asking you to bless my pimping. I ain’t that stupid. Lord, I \\nknow you ain’t black. Surely you know, if you’re up there, what it’s like to \\nbe black down here. These white folks are doing all the fine living and \\nsucking up all the gravy. I gotta have some of that living and some of that \\ngravy. \\n\\n“I don’t wanta be a stickup man or a dope peddler. I sure as hell won’t be a \\nporter or dishwasher. I just wanta pimp that’s all. It’s not too bad, because \\nwhores are rotten. Besides I ain’t going to croak them or drive them crazy. \\nI’m just going to pimp some real whitetype living out of them. \\n\\n“So Lord, if you’re up there listening, do one thing for me. Please don’t let \\nme croak before I live some and get to be somebody down here in the white \\nman’s world. I don’t care what happens after that.” \\n\\nI looked down over the parapet. I wondered if the undertaker had been \\nborn yet who was slick enough to paste a sucker’s ass together after a Brodie \\nfifteen-stories down. I heard “Tuxedo Junction” pulsing behind me. I had \\npitched my pipes dry. I upended my drink. \\n\\nI turned and walked toward the glass door. I saw the Japanese lanterns \\nsplashing color on the polished alabaster-topped tables. The Filipino had sure \\nbeen busy flopping his mop. I slid the door open to a chorus of profanity. The \\nwhore scent flared my nostrils. There must have been thirty yapping pimps \\nand whores lounging around the spacious pit. \\n\\nI stepped down and slid the door shut. An ebony satin-skinned pimp was \\nsprawled in the blue velour chair. A tawny tan tigress was kneeling before \\nhim between his legs. She had her chin rammed into his crotch. She clutched \\nhim around the waist like a humping twodollar trick in an alley. \\n\\nHer dreamy maroon eyes rolled toward the top of her long skull. She was \\nstaring at his fat blue lips. It was maybe she expected him to whistle the \\n“Lost Chord.” The rock on his finger exploded blue-white, frozen fireworks. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe raised his glass to curse all square bitches. He was con-toasting all \\nwhores. The room got silent. Somebody had strangled the gold phonograph in \\nthe corner. \\n\\nHe toasted: \\n\\n“Before I\\'d touch a square bitch\\'s slit, \\n\\nI\\'d suck a thousand clappy pricks and swim through liquid shit. \\n\\nThey got green puke between their rotten toes and snot runs from their \\nfunky noses. \\n\\nI hope all square bitches become syphilitic wrecks. I hope they fall \\nthrough their own ass-holes and break their mother-fucking \\nnecks.\" \\n\\nIt was the first time I’d heard it. It was the first time for the crowd, too. \\nThey roared and begged him to do it again. He looked toward the hand- \\npainted Chinese screen. \\n\\nAll eyes turned to Top and Sweet coming into the room. An old black stud \\nwearing a white silk patch over his right eye trailed behind them. Peaches \\nfollowed him. He looked like a vulture decked out in a gray mohair vine. \\nPeaches stood before the white velour couch and bared her fangs. \\n\\nThe three pimps sitting on it scattered off it like quail under a double- \\nbarreled shotgun. They thumped their rear ends to the carpet. Sweet, Top, and \\nPeaches sat on the couch. \\n\\nI sat on a satin pillow in the corner near the glass door. I watched the show. \\nI saw Patch Eye go and sit behind the bar. Everybody was in a big half-circle \\naround the couch. It was like the couch was a stage, and Sweet the star. \\n\\nSweet said, “Well how did you silly bastards like the fight? Did the Nigger \\nmurder that peckerwood or did his black ass turn shit yellow?” \\n\\nA Southern white whore with a wide face and a sultry voice like \\nBankhead’s drawled, “Mistah Jones, Ahm happy to repoat thet the Niggah \\nrun the white stud back intu his mammy’s ass in thu fust round.” \\n\\nEverybody laughed except Sweet. He was crashing together his mitts. I \\nwondered what madness bubbled in his skull as he stared at her. A high-ass \\nyellow broad flicked life back into the phonograph. “Gloomy Sunday,” the \\nsuicide’s favorite, dirged through the room. She stared at me as she came \\naway. \\n\\nSweet said, “All right you freakish pigs. Patch Eye’s got outfits and bags \\n\\n\\n\\nof poison. You got the go sign to croak yourselves.” \\n\\nThey started rising from the satin pillows and velour ottomans. They \\nclustered around Patch Eye at the bar. \\n\\nThe high-ass yellow broad came to me. She stooped in front of me. I saw \\nblack tracks on her inner thighs. The inside of her gaping cat was beef-steak \\nred. She had a shiv slash on the right side of her face. It was a livid gully \\nfrom her cheekbone to the corner of her twisted mouth. Smallpox craters \\ncovered her face. I caught the glint of a pearl-handled switch-blade in her \\nbosom. Her gray eyes were whirling in her skull. She was high. \\n\\nI was careful. I grinned. Sweet was digging us. He was shaking his head in \\ndisgust. I wondered if he thought I oughta slug her in the jib and maybe take \\nthat shiv in the gut. \\n\\nShe said, “Let me see that pretty dick, handsome.” \\n\\nI said, “I don’t show my swipe to strange bitches. I got a whore to pamper \\nmy swipe.” \\n\\nShe said, “Nigger, you ain’t heard of me? I’m Red Cora” from Detroit. \\nThat red is for blood. You ain’t hip I’m a thieving bitch that croaked two \\nstuds? Now I said show that dick. Call me Cora, little bullshit Nigger. Ain’t \\nyou a bitch with one whore? You gonna starve to death, Nigger, if she’s a \\nchump flat-backer. Nigger, you better get hip and cop a thief.” \\n\\nA big husky broad with a spike in one hand and pack of stuff in the other \\ntook me off the hook. She kneed Cora’s spine. \\n\\nShe said, “Bitch, I’m gonna shoot this dope. You want some? You can \\nGeorgia this skinny Nigger later.” \\n\\nI watched Cora’s rear end twist away from me. She and the husky broad \\nwent to the bar and got a spoon and a glass of water. I looked at Sweet. He \\nwas giving me a cold stare. \\n\\nI thought, “This track is too fast I can’t protect myself. With young soft \\nbitches like the runt I’m a champ. These old, hard bitches, I gotta solve. I \\ngotta be careful and not blow Sweet. If I sucker out anymore tonight he’ll \\nfreeze and boot me.” \\n\\nI sat in the corner bug-eyed for two hours. My ears flapped to the super¬ \\nslick dialogue. I was excited by the fast-paced, smooth byplay between these \\nwizards of pimpdom. \\n\\nRed Cora kept me edgy. She went to the patio several times. She was Hed \\nout of her skull. Each time she passed she cracked on me. She was sure \\npanting to view my swipe. \\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral of Sweet’s whores came in. None of them had been at the Roost \\nwith him that first time I saw him. All of them were fine with low mileage. \\nOne of them was yellow and beautiful. She couldn’t have been more than \\nseventeen. \\n\\nThere was a giant black pimp from the Apple. He had three of his whores \\nwith him. He had been boasting about how he had his swipe trained. He was \\none of the three at the party that didn’t bang stuff. I had watched him snort \\ngirl and down a few mixed drinks. He had a glass in his hand standing over \\nSweet and Top on the couch. \\n\\nHe said, “Sweet, ain’t a bitch living can pop me off unless I want her to. I \\ndon’t care if she’s got velvet suction cups in her cat. Her jib can have a \\ncollege degree, she ain’t gonna make me pop against my will. I got the \\ntoughest swipe in the world. I got a C note to back my crack.” \\n\\nSweet said, “Sucker, I got a young bitch I turned out six months ago that \\ncould blow that tender sucker swipe of yours in five minutes. I ain’t going to \\nteach you no lesson for a measly C note. If that C note ain’t all you got, put \\nfive bills in Top’s mitt and you got a bet.” \\n\\nThe big joker snatched a roll from his side pocket. He plunked five C notes \\ninto Top’s palm. Sweet eased a bale of C notes from the pocket of his \\nsmoking jacket. He covered the bet in Top’s hand. \\n\\nSweet snapped his fingers. The beautiful yellow broad kneeled before the \\nstanding giant. She started to perform before the cheering audience. Within \\nless than three minutes she had won the bet for Sweet. \\n\\nThe big joker stood there for a long moment with his eyes closed. He had a \\ngoofy grin on his face. One of his whores snickered. He slapped her hard \\nagainst the jaw. He went to the bar. \\n\\nI thought, “She sure has a head for business. Pepper was great, but she \\ncouldn’t hold this broad’s douche bag.” \\n\\nI got up and went behind the Chinese screen through the door. I went down \\na long hall. I passed three way-out bedrooms. I went into a mirrored john. It \\nwas as big as a bedroom. I pushed the door shut. I should have locked it. \\n\\nI walked to the stool. I raised the lid. That tough bitch Red Cora darted in. \\nShe was licking out her red tongue. Her gray eyes were voodooing in her \\nskull. She was hot as hell for my relative innocence and youth. She was a \\ndouble murderess with a skull load of H and a hot jib. \\n\\nI stood there before the deadly bitch. I searched the thin catalogue in my \\nskull. I didn’t know the right crack for a situation like this. I mumbled a \\n\\n\\n\\nplaintive pitch. \\n\\nI said, “Now listen girl, you haven’t given me a nickel. I’m not your man.” \\n\\nIt was like trying to stand off a starving leopard with a broom straw. She \\nsnaked that shiv out of her bosom and popped the gleaming blade open. She \\nclawed my fly open with the other hand. I heard buttons bounce on the tile \\nfloor. My ticker was doing a fox trot. \\n\\nShe said, “You jiving pretty sonuvabitch. You ain’t no pimp. I’m gonna eat \\nyour sweat ass up or chop off your dick.” \\n\\nI backed up to the wall beside the stool. I could feel the wet throbbing tips \\nof my fingers against the cool tile. She was grabbing inside when Sweet \\nbulled in. He seized a fistful of her long hair. She squealed in pain. He jerked \\nher away from me toward the door. He cussed her as he drove his needle-toed \\nshoe into her wide caboose several times. \\n\\nHe said, “Bull-shit bitch, this chump is in my school. I ain’t gonna let you \\nGeorgia him. Now nix, bitch, nix.” \\n\\nI heard her high heels staccato against the tile as she fled. He turned toward \\nme. His black face was gray with fury. Maybe Sweet would forget I wasn’t \\nyellow. I remembered what Top had told me about those four murders. \\n\\nHe thrust his flat black nose against mine. I could feel a spray of spit strike \\nmy lips as he cursed me. He twisted the collar of my vine like a garrote \\naround my throat. He had snatched me six feet from the wall. \\n\\nHe shouted, “Listen you stupid little motherfucker. You know why that \\nbitch screwed you around? You always grinning like a Cheshire Cat. What’s \\nfunny? Can’t I get the sucker outta you? I can’t make a pimp outta a pussy \\nlike you. \\n\\n“I told you once, do I have to tell you a thousand times? Greenass Nigger, \\nto be a good pimp, you gotta be icy, cold like the inside of a dead-whore’s \\npussy. Now if you a bitch, a sissy, or something let me know. I’ll put you in \\ndrag and you can whore for me. Stay outta my face Nigger, until you freeze \\nup and stop that sucker grinning.” \\n\\nI heard his ground grippers skid against the floor as he hurled me against \\nthe wall. The back of my skull torpedoed into it. Through a drowsy fog of \\npain I saw him float away. \\n\\nMy back snailed down the wall. I laughed at the funny way the shoe tips \\nturned in as the long legs glided across the tile. I sat there on the cool floor \\ngazing at the weird comical legs stretched out before me. \\n\\nI saw a pair of blue mohair legs right angle the flat ones. I looked up. It \\n\\n\\n\\nwas Top. He bent over to help me up. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, now you believe the ugly bastard is insane? Take this key to \\nmy Hog. Get it outta the lot in back. Park in the block and cool it. I’m getting \\noutta here myself as soon as I cop my end of the smack scratch.” \\n\\nI riveted my eyes to the champagne carpet. I zigzagged through the \\nsnickering whores and pimps. I made it across the pit to the elevator. The \\nFilipino was standing beside it. He was pressing the down button. \\n\\nHe looked like a friendly brown snake sausaged in gold foil. He reached up \\nand stroked my jacket collar down flat from around my ears. He took my lid \\noff the pearl tree. He stuck it on my skull and snapped the brim. I felt the \\nsweat band needle the aching boil. I adjusted my lid. \\n\\nHe said, “Good night, Sir. Sammee hopes you had fine time.” \\n\\nI said, “Sammee pal, it’s been a wild night. I’ll never forget it.” \\n\\nI got a whiff of crotch as the elevator plunged to the lobby. I wondered if \\nthe pretty brown-skin jockey whored a little bit as a sideline. \\n\\nI stepped out of the gilded cage into the lobby. I saw a winking red- \\narrowed sign in the rear. I walked to the glass door below it. I went down the \\nwhite stone steps to the parking lot. \\n\\nI spotted Top’s red Hog in the ocean of cars. I went to it, unlocked it and \\ngot in. A big white Buick was parked in front of it. A grinning brown-skin \\njoker in white overalls came toward the Buick. \\n\\nI saw Smitty blue-stitched across his breast pocket. He pulled the Buick \\nout. I keyed the Hog and scooted it out of the lot. I whipped around the \\ncorner and coasted to the curb fifty feet from the entrance of Sweet’s \\napartment building. \\n\\nI shut the motor off. I lowered the driver’s side window. I put my lid on the \\nseat. I threw my head back on the top of the seat. I closed my eyes. I dozed. \\nSomething was crushing my jaw. A blinding spotlight burned into my \\neyeballs. I heard a fog-horn voice. \\n\\nIt blasted, “Police officers! Nigger, what the hell you doing. What’s your \\nname? Show us your identification.” \\n\\nI couldn’t answer with my jaw crushed in a vise. I was dazed. I lowered \\nmy eyes below the inferno of light. I saw a white brutish wrist. Thick black \\nhair bristled on it. I saw muscles cord and ripple across it as the vise \\ntightened around my jawbone. I wondered if the copper was Satan and I had \\ncroaked in the Hog and was being checked into Hell. Hell or not, Satan \\nwanted identification. I remembered the Fox and the Horse. I didn’t even \\n\\n\\n\\nhave a hide. \\n\\nSatan swung the Hog door open. The door frame blackjacked the top of my \\nskull as Satan yanked me from the Hog. He released my jaw and slammed me \\nacross the hood of the Hog. My wet palms skidded on the top of it. \\n\\nSatan’s fellow demon was punch-frisking me from breast to shoe soles. He \\npoked an index finger inside my shoe. I felt a tickle in the arch of my instep. \\n\\nI said, “My name is Albert Thomas. Hell, I wasn’t doing anything officers. \\nI was just waiting for my uncle. I lost my wal—.” \\n\\nI didn’t finish. A galaxy of shooting stars orbited my skull. It was like a \\nflame-hot poker was imbedded in that sore bump at the back of my skull. \\n\\nI heard the tinkle of glass against the hood. I puked and nosedived to the \\nhood. I felt the warm stinking mess against my cheek as I lay across the hood \\ngasping. \\n\\nGlass splinters sparkled on the hood. Satan had slugged his flashlight \\nagainst my skull. I saw the fellow demon’s shadow bobbing inside the hog. \\nHe was frisking it, too. \\n\\nSatan said, “Nigger, you got a sheet downtown? Whatta you do for a \\nliving?” \\n\\nI whispered, “I’ve never been in trouble. I’m an entertainer. I’m a dancer.” \\n\\nHe said, “You black, conning bastard. How in the fuck do you know what \\na sheet is? You been mugged. Nigger. Stand up straight. I’m gonna take you \\ndowntown. You can jig a few steps on the ‘show up’ stage.” \\n\\nI struggled off the hood. I turned and faced him. I looked up into the red, \\npuffy face. Top came around the back of the Hog and stood between us. \\n\\nHe said, “What’s the beef, officer? This is my nephew and my Cadillac. \\nThe kid was waiting for me. He’s clean. We been to a party at Sweet’s. You \\nknow who he is. We’re personal friends of his, you dig?” \\n\\nSatan’s puffy face creased into a hyena grin. He rapped on the windshield. \\nI saw the demon’s starch-white face peer over the rear seat. Satan waved him \\nfrom the Hog. He clambered out and stood beside Satan. \\n\\nSatan said, “Looks like we made a slight mistake, Johnnie. These \\ngentlemen are pals of Mr. Jones. Mister, all your nephew had to do to beat \\nthe roust was mention a name. \\n\\n“Christ, we have to do our job. There’s a cat burglar operating in this \\ndistrict. The lieutenant is riding our asses to nab him. Sorry about the whole \\nthing gentlemen.” \\n\\nThe rollers walked across the street. They got into a black Chevrolet and \\n\\n\\n\\ngunned it away. I took a handkerchief from my back pocket, and wiped my \\nface. \\n\\nI wiped the bits of loose glass and most of the puke off the hood. I threw \\nthe rag in the gutter. I got in the Hog. Top u-turned and headed back to Black \\nTown. I touched the bump on my skull. I felt a spot of sticky ooze. My skull \\nhad only a tiny split. I wiped my fingers on the end of my lapel pocket \\nhandkerchief. \\n\\nI thought, “If it gets any rougher on this track. I’ll be punchy before long. \\nMaybe I better take Preston’s advice and go back to the sticks.” \\n\\nI said, “Jeez, Sweet Jones sure has got pull. It was like magic when you \\ncracked his name.” \\n\\nTop said, “Magic your black ass. The only magic is in that C note a week \\nSweet lays on ’em. Every copper in the district from Captain down greases \\nhis mitts in that lard bucket in Sweet’s pocket. \\n\\n“Mary, mammy of Jesus, you stink. You musta shit in your pants. You sure \\ngetting funky breaks. Kid. Too bad you couldn’t handle Red Cora. She’s one \\nof the fastest thieves in the country.” \\n\\nI said, “Look Top, if that crazy, pocked-face bitch had a tunnel straight \\ninto Fort Knox, I wouldn’t fart in her jib. I hate old hard-leg whores.” \\n\\nHe said, “That’s a chump crack. After you get hip to the pimp game you’ll \\ntake scratch from a gold-toothed, three-legged bulldog with two heads. Say \\nlisten, Kid, don’t ever forget to keep that rundown on Sweet under your lid. \\nI’m the only stud he told. He’d twist my skull off and play soccer with it.” \\n\\nI said, “Now Top, that’s a helluva crack to make. Do I look like the kind of \\nrat square that would cross a pal?” \\n\\nI was glad when I saw the Haven’s blue sign. Top parked across the street \\nfrom it. I got out. I had crossed to the middle of the street. Top blew the horn. \\nI turned back to the side of the Hog. Top had my lid and a small square of \\npaper in his hand. I took them. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, here’s my phone number in case you wanta ring me for \\nsomething. Take it easy now.” \\n\\nI passed through the lobby. The indicator pointed out the elevator was at \\nthe fourth floor. I took the stairs and picked up the sizzle from the broom \\ncloset. The runt let me in after the first knock. I walked by her to the bedroom \\nand stuck the sizzle in a coat pocket in the closet. I started taking my stinking \\nclothes off. She was standing in the doorway. I tossed them in a pile in the \\n\\n\\ncorner. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, when you passed me you smelled like you’d been \\ndunked in a garbage truck. What happened?” \\n\\nI headed for the bathroom. I was standing over the stool. She followed me. \\nShe stood in the bathroom doorway. I looked over my shoulder at her. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, some white rollers busted me tonight. They got the wire I’m \\nin town to pimp. They took me down and beat the puke outta me. Baby, they \\nwanted me to finger you. They wanted to know where you worked. Shit, I \\nwas too pure in heart to put a finger on you, baby. I’m not feeling worth a \\ndamn, so go on the dummy, okay?” \\n\\nI flushed the toilet. I turned the shower on. I gave her a hard look and \\nfrowned. She turned and got into bed. I took Mickey off. It was four a.m. I \\nshowered and toweled off. I fell into bed without checking the scratch on the \\ndresser. I went to sleep wondering what to do to solve the fast track. \\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\nTHE BUTTERFLY \\n\\n\\nI woke up. The sun was noon bright. I heard a squad of rats or something in \\nthe direction of the closet. I turned and looked. It was the runt. She was on \\nher knees in the closet scraping and pulling suitcases and shoes around. The \\nback of my skull was sore and throbbing. I touched it, and felt a crusty cap \\nover the bump. \\n\\nI thought as I watched the runt’s rear end, “What the hell is she doing?” \\n\\nI said, “Damn Bitch, can’t you put a damper on that racket? I gotta aching \\nskull. I wake up, the first living thing I pin is the rusty black ass of a dizzy \\nwhore. She’s digging a ditch in the closet. Now there’s gotta be a prettier way \\nto start a day.” \\n\\nShe snapped her head around and said, “I’m looking for the reefer. I feel \\nlow. Where did you stash it? I couldn’t find it last night when I came in.” \\n\\nI got up and went to the closet. I ran my hand into the coat pocket stash. I \\nseparated my stuff from the reefer inside the pocket. I gave her the can. I saw \\ntwo lonely saw bucks on the dresser. I went back and got into bed. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I take an outside stash, where else?” I don’t wanta come \\nhome some night and greet a roller. Wouldn’t it be a bitch if he had that can \\nof one to two in the penitentiary in his mitt? \\n\\n“Christ, your scratch for last night is shitty. What happened? Some joker \\nstick you up? That reefer ain’t making you lazy is it? A double-saw take for a \\nyoung freak bitch is outrageous. Shit, you broke your luck for the double saw \\nwith the lover. Sugar Blue Eyes. \\n\\n“You musta shot a blank the rest of the night. I’ll murder you, bitch, if I \\nfind out you freak off all night with your tricks for a double saw.” \\n\\nShe was licking at the sides of the joint she had rolled. She sat on the side \\nof the bed next to me. She rolled her sassy eyes at me. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I’m your girl. If I ever stop loving you. I’m gonna quit \\nwhoring for you. If you don’t croak me I’ll get another black man when \\nwe’re washed up. Right now I’m in your corner all the way. \\n\\n“White tricks don’t move me. I want to vomit when they paw and slobber \\nover me. I baby talk them, but I hate them. Daddy, I just want their scratch. I \\nget a thrill with them all right. It knocks me out that here I am, a black Nigger \\nbitch, taking their scratch. \\n\\n“A lot of them are clean-cut high muckty mucks in the white world. Some \\nof them show me pictures of beautiful wives and cute children. It makes me \\nfeel greater than those white bitches living in soft luxury. Those white broads \\ngot Nigger maids they laugh at. They think we ain’t good for nothing but \\nclowning and cleaning. It would give them a stroke to see their trick \\nhusbands moaning and groaning and licking between a black whore’s thighs. \\n\\n“I know I ain’t got no silky hair and white skin. I’m damn sure hip those \\nwhite men ain’t leaving Heaven to come to Hell every night just for the drive. \\nThey coming because those cold-ass white broads in Heaven ain’t got what \\nthese black whores in Hell got between their legs. Black and low as I am, I \\ngot secrets with their white men those high-class white bitches ain’t hip to. \\n\\n“Now Daddy, we rap so little I got earned away. I ain’t nobody’s fool but \\nyours. I wanted to rundown to you this morning about last night. You put me \\non the dummy remember? After I turned Chuck at the Martin, I got a roust. \\nTwo white vice coppers picked me up. They rode me around and felt over \\nme. One of them was a mean, nasty bastard. The other, blond nice one, was \\nsorry for me. \\n\\n“Nasty said, T know this black bitch is a cinch ringer for those eight \\nlarceny from the person beefs. We oughta take her down and put her on a \\nShow Up or two. What the hell Carl, we know she’s a whore.” \\n\\n“Blondie said, ‘But Max, she ain’t no hard leg. She’s just a beautiful young \\nsexy kid with a mother to support. You know how tough it is for Boots to get \\nthree squares and a roof in this town. Let’s give her a break and cut her loose. \\nJesus Max, this broad has got a pair of thighs on her. She’s soft as kitten fur.’ \\n\\n“Nasty said, ‘Carl, you sure got a weak spot for spades. This broad says \\nshe’s broke. That black ass of her’s ain’t enough to buy a pass from me. If \\nshe ain’t too shy to show what her Derby’s like, maybe, I say just maybe, I \\nmight give her a break.’ \\n\\n“I’m driving into this alley. Carl, you test her lid and snatch. If you ain’t \\nraving how great it is upstairs and down when you finish. I’m gonna wheel \\n\\n\\n\\noutta this alley and toss her black ass in jail ... I’m gonna book her on those \\neight counts of larceny. If she’s lucky she’ll get a deuce.’ \\n\\n“Daddy, Blondie pushed my head down to his lap. Then I got on the back \\nseat with him. That freak bastard. Max, turned around and kept his flashlight \\non us the whole time. I made Blondie holler. \\n\\n“I finished with Blondie. Max got back there with me. For a half hour he \\ncalled me filthy names. He punched and pinched me. I’m sure sore all over. \\nBlondie begged him to stop. My ass feels like he split something back there. I \\nhad a rough time. \\n\\n“Finally they let me out. Max told me to never let him see me again. I was \\nscared so I came in. That’s why the scratch is short. Max will bust me if he \\nsees me again. You gonna have to find me another street to work.” \\n\\nI said, “You square-ass stupid bitch. You think you’re a brain because \\nyou’re hip that white men sneak through the stockade to lay black whores. \\nAin’t a Nigger sealed in here that don’t know that. It don’t make you great \\nbecause those white sick fools leave that fine pussy in Heaven to find your \\nstinking black ass in Hell. \\n\\n“You chicken-hearted bitch. You got a roust. They conned you to believe \\nthey could slap a bum rap on you. You’re too dumb to know I’m gonna raise \\nyou. You rammed your funky finger in your sore ass. You took a powder \\nfrom the track with a lousy double saw. You let those peckerwood coppers \\nfuck you front rear, sideways, and across. You simple bitch, I’m gonna find \\nyou another street to work? Now you got like a license to hustle this one? \\n\\n“You ain’t got to worry about Max and that other roller. Bitch, you can \\nwork it forever just so you don’t get cancer of the cat or lockjaw. Bitch, if \\nyou don’t get outta my face I’m going to the chair for slaughtering you. Get \\nyour clothes on. Get in the street and hump up some scratch. Bitch, don’t \\ncome to that door unless you call me first. I ain’t going nowhere.” \\n\\nShe had been taking sucks on the reefer while she was rapping. She was \\nhigh when I gave her the rundown on how she had been conned by the \\nrollers. She leaped off the bed and went to the closet. She dressed and jerked \\nher head around the whole time. \\n\\nShe knew I was angry. She was maybe afraid after that slaughter crack that \\nI might goose her in the butt with my knife. She got out fast. I had Silas bring \\nme some food and take my shirts and things to the cleaners. I ate and snorted \\nsome Girl. Later I banged some. Except for the bump on my skull that still \\nached a little I felt all right. \\n\\n\\n\\nI remembered Satan and the Demon wanting to see identification. I called \\nSilas. He told me where to go. I could get a driver’s license without a test for \\na saw buck under the counter. I dressed and made the trip. Sure enough I \\ncopped. I was back home in an hour. \\n\\nI pulled a chair to the front window. I had my spy glass. It was still \\ndaylight. I didn’t see the runt on the street. I spied into the greasy spoon \\nacross the street. The runt was sitting at the counter talking to a big black stud \\nin overalls. He had trick engraved all over him. I saw them leave together and \\ncome across the street toward the Martin Hotel. \\n\\nThe scarfaced horn tooter who lived in four-twenty-two across the hall \\ncame out behind them alone. He got into a battered Ford and chugged away. \\nIt gave me an idea. After all, I could blow the runt. I picked up the phone and \\nasked for connection to apartment four-twenty-two. The pretty yellow ex¬ \\nwhore “helloed.” I was glad old Silas had given me a rundown on her. I could \\ntailor my pitch. \\n\\nI said, “Now try to control yourself baby. I’m the tall stud with the dreamy \\nbedroom eyes across the hall in four-twenty. I’m the guy with the pretty \\ntowel wrapped around his sexy hips. I got the same hips on now that you x- \\nrayed. Remember that hump of sugar your peepers feasted on?” \\n\\nShe said, “Maybe, but you shouldn’t call me. I don’t want an incident. \\nWhat do you want? A lady doesn’t accept phone calls from strangers.” \\n\\nI said, “A million dollars and a trip to the moon with a bored, trapped, \\nbeautiful bitch, you dig? I’m no stranger. I’ve been popping the elastic on \\nyour panties ever since you saw me in the hall.” \\n\\nShe giggled. I could hear the thrill in her voice. The horn blower had taken \\nher off the track, but the whore was alive and thrashing inside her. She had \\nclass. She had done more than screw on the fire escape at high school. \\n\\nShe said, “I don’t drink and besides I don’t know you.” \\n\\nI said, “You met me in your first hot dream, remember? You know that \\npretty joker in your little girl dreams that always faded when you woke up \\nwet between the legs. You waited and wished. \\n\\n“You lucky bitch. I’ve stepped out of your dreams. I’m alive and real \\nacross the hall from you. Get over here. I’m gonna turn you on. Don’t worry \\nabout the watch dog. I saw him split out of the greasy spoon ten minutes ago. \\nBaby, I’m gonna have to make one of my whores bake you a cake with a saw \\nin it.” \\n\\nShe said, “You’re not married to one of them? I don’t want my throat cut. I \\n\\n\\n\\ndon’t want to break an old habit, breathing.” \\n\\nI said, “Yeah, I’m married. I’m married to the whore game. You’re still a \\nmember of the club yourself. You just ain’t paid any dues lately. Maybe if \\nyou ain’t full of shit I can put you back in good standing. Now get over \\nhere!” \\n\\nShe said, “I’m raw. I’ll have to slip on something. I’ll come over for a \\nminute. You’re not a hype? I’m not hip to anything but grass.” \\n\\nI said, “No, sugar. I’m a lover and a beggar. I got black gunion, baby. You \\nhip?” \\n\\nI hung up. I went to the dresser mirror and powdered my face. I brushed \\nmy hair with a damp brush. My mop was black, bright and curly. I went to \\nthe closet and slipped on a wild yellow lounging robe. I had bought it the day \\nbefore Dalanski busted me at the dance. \\n\\nI had peeped at her hole card that day in the hall. I knew she was a freak. I \\nremembered her eyes chained to my crotch. Now I didn’t have on any towel. \\nFirst chance I got I’d flash her into a boil, through the split in the front of the \\nrobe. \\n\\nMaybe I could shoot some cocaine into that yellow virgin arm. That would \\nopen her up for sure. I might even steal her from scarface and put her back on \\nthe track tomorrow. \\n\\nI thought, “This fine bitch is my speed. She’s not a hard-leg dog with a \\nmillion miles on her. She’s no more than nineteen and sexy as the rear end of \\na peacock. I’ll play it cool and quiz her. Maybe some asskicker booted her off \\nthe track. Maybe that’s how scarface copped. \\n\\n“I’ll stay in the pimp role, but I’ll sweeten it with a little highclass bullshit. \\nMaybe I’ll rap some of that gigolo garbage I overheard the white pimps in the \\njoint rapping. \\n\\n“I better call Silas. I’m not ready for trouble with Scarface. I went to the \\ndoor and unlocked it. I picked up the phone and got Silas. \\n\\nI said, “Listen Jack, this is important. I’m gonna be rapping to the big-butt \\nyellow broad who lives in four-twenty-two. I’m gonna give you and the \\nbroad on the desk a fin a piece. You gotta wire me here when Scarface \\nshows. I’m not ready for him to wise up. Got me?” \\n\\nSilas said, “You lucky young sonuvabitch. A faggot in a Y.M.C.A. shower \\nroom ain’t no luckier. You got salt and pepper, kid. We’ll wire you. I’ll stall \\nthe cage on the way up with him. Can I peep a little, kid, huh?” \\n\\nI hung up. I felt a cool puff of draft on my ankles. I went into the living \\n\\n\\n\\nroom. She had slipped into almost nothing. She was crossed legged in the \\nchair at the window. She turned her head from the street and looked up at me. \\n\\nShe had on a thigh-long black negligee with pink butterflies sewn on. A \\npair of white silk panties gleamed through the black gauze. She curved inside \\nit like a yellow Petty Girl. Her ebony hair was steepled on top of her skull \\nlike a black satin crown. I saw a frantic tic jerk at a corner of her melon-red \\nmouth. If she turned out to have entasis, I swore I would give up whores and \\nget hip to the sissy game. \\n\\nShe said, “Hi. I ask myself why I’m here?” \\n\\nI said, “Baby, don’t drag the party. Don’t ask yourself stupid questions. \\nYou can’t escape that freak, desperate spark. You know baby, that awful \\nsweet electricity that makes a farm boy kiss a ewe. The same power that \\nyowls a hot torn cat in the alley. You hip to it? Now just relax. I’m gonna roll \\nyou up a bomber. Baby, your luck has changed. You’ve hit the jackpot. You \\nfound me. Oh yea, my name is Blood.” \\n\\nShe said, “‘Blood’ it’s nice to meet you. I’m Christine. Chris I like better. I \\ncan’t stay long. I have to be careful. My old man is very jealous.” \\n\\nI said, “Chris, you are gonna find out I’m a wild groove. You may stay a \\nlifetime thinking it was only an hour. All we need is an understanding. All \\nyou need is a man.” \\n\\nOver the top of Chris’s head I saw the runt flash her eyes up at the \\nwindow. She was just getting into a white trick’s car. Twilight was sweeping \\naway daylight with a deep purple broom. I went to the bedroom. I loaded an \\noutfit and tilted it spike up in my pocket. I rolled two bombers. One with \\nreefer, the other in cigarette tobacco. I snorted a thumb tip of cocaine. I got a \\ntowel and put it next to the gap under the front door. I lit some incense. \\n\\nI gave Chris the bomber. I lit it and my dud. With a package like Chris, \\nreefer might confuse me. I might wake up swindled. If she had been Garbo, I \\nstill wanted scratch before snatch. \\n\\nI got another chair. We sat there facing each other in the twilight. I waited \\nfor the reefer to fill her skull. The bomber in her hand was now a roach. I \\ncock-tailed it for her. Her eyes were dreamy. \\n\\nShe said, “Goddamnit sweetheart, I’m high. You know Blood you’re going \\nto laugh when I tell you something. Guess what I was thinking when I saw \\nyou the first time in that towel?” \\n\\nI said, “You thought, ‘Oh my itching cat! That pretty brown bastard looks \\nlike a pimp. I wish to hell I was still whoring. I sure would like to kiss “Mr. \\n\\n\\n\\nThriller, the killer” under that towel.’ Am I right, sweet freak?” \\n\\nShe giggled and scooted her chair flush against my knees. She slid her \\nback down in the leather chair. She put the heels of her pink shoes on the seat \\nof my chair. \\n\\nI was sandwiched between her big yellow legs. The street lamp came on, \\nspotlighting her. She was still giggling. I fingered the ready jolt of cocaine in \\nmy robe pocket. I took it out and hid it against the side of my chair. I saw \\nblue veins pulsing on her inner thighs. \\n\\nThe cocaine had me strung on an icy rack. I raised her right leg and rubbed \\nmy cheek against it. I crushed her knee-cap between my teeth. She moaned. I \\ngazed deep into her eyes. She had laughed tiny pearls of tears that clung to \\nher long, silky lashes. Under the street lamp her face was innocent and soft as \\na yellow fawn’s. I felt old as Methuselah. \\n\\nShe said, “Don’t look at me like that. I know you can read minds. You give \\nme the creeps with that look. It’s like you’re Svengali or that crazy Russian \\nMonk I read about” \\n\\nI said, “Chris, you’re gonna be my whore. We gotta share things. That \\nreefer was just an appetizer. Reefer is for low-class skunk broads. Heroin is \\nfor chumps bound for the graveyard. Cocaine is for brilliant, beautiful people. \\n\\n“Chris, banging cocaine will spin a magic web of music and bells inside \\nyour skull. Every pore in your body will feel like Daddy’s jugging his swipe \\nin all over you. It will torch off a racy secret fire of life inside you. It’s a \\nmiracle, Chris. You get all that thrill and no habit. I know you ain’t chicken \\nshit. Are you game to try?” \\n\\nShe said, “If it won’t scar me or hurt me. If it hurts, promise you’ll stop. \\nDon’t give me a lot. Baby. Where you going to put it in?” \\n\\nI took her left leg and put it on the arm of my chair. I saw a fat line high up \\non her thigh. I eased the spike into it. She flinched. The dropper flashed red. I \\npressed the bulb slowly. Her eyes widened. Her white teeth bit into her \\nbottom lip. \\n\\nI emptied the dropper. I pulled out the gun. She sat there stiffly. She took \\nher leg off the chair arm. She rubbed the inside knobs of her ankles against \\nmy sides. I saw her Adam’s apple spasm. \\n\\nI remembered how I puked the first time. I slid my chair back and raced to \\nthe bedroom to get the wastebasket. I just made it back. She dumped a load \\ninto it. I flushed the mess down the toilet and rinsed the basket out. When I \\ngot back to her she was smiling and stroking her legs. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, “I’m sorry I did that naughty thing, Daddy. Oh! Oh! But now I \\nfeel heavenly. Baby, I’m so glad I came over and got this feeling. Aren’t \\nthose bells something? Baby, you got a lot of this? I want to do this every \\nday. Stay like this every minute. Let’s lie down. I want a formal introduction \\nto Mr. Thriller.” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, when you come to me as my whore I’ll keep your skull \\nmellow. Now you gotta be joking about Mr. Thriller. He won’t have anything \\nto do with a broke bitch that claims a square horn blower as her man. Let’s go \\nover there while he’s away and get your clothes. You’re not married to him \\nare you?” \\n\\nShe said, “How many girls do you have? Maybe your stable is too big for \\ncomfort. I get salty standing in a long line for my loving.” \\n\\nI said, “Whore, answer my question. What are you, a roller or something? \\nWhen you are my whore you don’t worry about anything but your own ass \\nand scratch. Now answer my question.” \\n\\nShe said, “Blood, I didn’t want to answer because I am married to him. \\nLeroy, that’s my husband, saved my life really. He’s been wonderful to me. \\nHe used to be good looking. He didn’t get so insanely jealous until after his \\naccident. \\n\\n“We’ve been waiting over two years for a settlement. Blood, honestly, you \\nare my kind of stud. My life is so screwed up. I don’t know what to do. I \\ndon’t know what to tell you. Would you believe that you’re the first fellow \\nI’ve talked to in over two years? Blood, I don’t love Leroy.” \\n\\nThat cocaine had her speed rapping. I couldn’t cop her tonight unless I \\ncroaked Scarface. My plans had to change. I had to unhook her from Leroy \\nsoon. She’d make bales of scratch. Maybe I could work an angle to get her \\nand a slice of that settlement. Of course, I couldn’t wait forever. If I had to. \\nI’d cop without a slice of the settlement. \\n\\nI knew Leroy was going to blow her. He didn’t have a chance to hold \\nmuch longer with that ugly face and that jealous bit. I had to find out if she \\nwould level with me all the way. Silas had told me she was an ex-whore. \\n\\nI said, “Chris, give me a fast rundown of your life story. I’ll have all the \\nanswers for you when you finish.” \\n\\nShe said, “If you let me sit in your lap.” \\n\\nI nodded and she climbed onto my lap. She hooked an arm around my \\nneck. Her cheek was against my ear. The cocaine thudded her ticker against \\nmy breast. Out of the side of my eye I saw the runt go into the greasy spoon. I \\n\\n\\n\\nwas hoping she wouldn’t use the phone just inside the door and interrupt the \\nrundown. \\n\\nI felt her balloon bottom blasting heat to the throbbing cup of my lap. Too \\nbad I worked so hard at the pimp game. Mr. Thriller was playing stiff con on \\nme. He was just a fool at heart. The poor chump wanted to sucker out in that \\nbed with this luscious doll. Good thing he had me to stand guard over him. \\n\\nShe said, “I remember nothing but good until I was twelve. Then my \\nmother died. My father had been a kind, good man, until then. He always \\nworked. He was a good carpenter. He changed quickly after Mama died. \\n\\n“He took my bed down. He said he wanted me to sleep with him. He told \\nme how lonely his bed was after all those years with Mama. Nothing \\nhappened at first. One night a month later I had a nightmare. A wild ferocious \\nanimal was sucking my breast. It was terrible. I woke up. It was Papa. \\n\\n“I screamed. He slapped me hard. His face was all twisted and hateful. He \\nlooked like a crazy stranger. I blacked out. When I came to Papa was crying \\nand begging me to forgive him. \\n\\n“After a while I would just lie there, numb and let him use me. I hated his \\nguts. In school I had the crazy feeling the students could see and feel my \\nshame and filth. By the time I got fifteen I was a skeleton. By now he had me \\ndoing everything to him. I’m glad he’s dead in Hell. \\n\\n“Papa, the beast, was killing me. I was so nervous I couldn’t wash dishes. I \\nbroke dozens. I wasn’t eating enough to keep a bird alive. I collapsed one day \\ncoming from the grocery. I woke up in a hospital. My system was shot and I \\nwas pregnant. I stayed in the hospital a month. I stayed at Papa’s a week after \\nI got out. I took some money while he slept and left Wichita with the clothes \\non my back. \\n\\n“I came here and got a waitress job. A young pimp named Dandy Louee \\nstarted picking me up when I got off. I thought he was a millionaire. He \\ndressed me up and turned me out. He was a cruel black bastard. He liked to \\nbeat me, and then screw me. He worked me in a house run by one of his \\nwhores. He kept his foot in my ass. \\n\\n“Funny thing, I made money even when my belly was stuck way out. A lot \\nof tricks who came there wanted a pregnant girl. I lost the baby while turning \\na trick. Dandy got five years on a white slave rap two months later. \\n\\n“I got a bar-maid job and met Leroy. He was playing a gig in the spot. I \\nwas a sick girl. I fell out twice while serving the bar. The doctor said I needed \\nrest. He said I couldn’t expect to live long unless I rested. Leroy nursed me \\n\\n\\n\\nback to health. \\n\\n“He was good to me. I needed someone who cared. I married him when I \\nwas just four months shy of seventeen. I went with Leroy on a string of one- \\nnighters in the Midwest. The group broke up in Youngstown, Ohio. We were \\nstranded. Leroy got a job in an industrial cleaning plant. The second week a \\nboiler exploded and you’ve seen his face. \\n\\n“His lawyer says we can expect a ten-thousand dollar settlement any time \\nnow. Leroy is driving roe crazy with his jealousy. I don’t mind hustling. I’d \\nbe your girl, “Blood. I go for you. Blood. Are things clearer now? What \\nshould I do?” \\n\\nI said, “You’ve had nothing but heartache. I feel so sorry for you, baby. \\nNow I know you’ve got to be my woman. I gotta protect you. I gotta give you \\naffection and understanding. Don’t worry angel, with me life will be smooth \\nas the snow at Sun Valley. \\n\\n“You’ll be so happy you’ll be out of your mind half the time. With our \\ncolor combination we could make a sonuvabitching baby together after we \\nget rich. Tell me, does Leroy plan to work the Roost for a while?” \\n\\nShe said, “Oh! I forgot to tell you. Last night was his last night. They want \\nhim for another six weeks, but he’s going to drop the Combo. It’s too much \\nheadache to get them to show for work sober and on time. \\n\\n“He’s out now with a booking agent. I think he might go with a big band \\non an East-Coast tour. I hope he gets it. Band leaders want band members’ \\nwives to stay at home. Daddy, please figure things out fast. I want to be your \\ngirl as soon as possible.” \\n\\nI was sucking her scented cheek. I flogged my skull for a quick plot to tear \\nthe yellow gold mine from Scarface. The phone rang. She got out of her nest. \\nI rushed to the phone. It was the excited broad on the desk. \\n\\nShe said, “Forgive me for goofing. Four-twenty-two went up two minutes \\nago. I was having a hassle with a check out. I saw him come in. It didn’t \\nregister until the second that I called you. You better clean house fast.” \\n\\nI ran into the living room. I snatched her from the chair. I pulled her to the \\ndoor. I cracked it. We peeped down the hall. Scarface was twenty yards away \\ncoming down the hall. He had a big stack of papers, maybe sheet music under \\nhis arm. He shifted the bundle to his other arm. \\n\\nA paper fluttered to the carpet. He stooped to get it. I saw her door ajar. I \\nstepped aside. I slapped her on the rump. She blurred across through her \\ndoorway. Scarface was standing with his mouth open staring toward his now \\n\\n\\n\\nlocked door. \\n\\nHe was sure he’d seen her. His face was puzzled. I shut my door easy like. \\nI stood with my ear against the door. A bomb of sound shocked my eardrum. \\nSomeone was punching his fist against my door. I ran into the bedroom and \\ngot my switch-blade. I came back to the door. I held the open blade behind \\nme. I opened the door. \\n\\nIt was Scarf ace. He looked like Mr. Hyde all right. His orangebrown eyes \\nwere spinning counter clockwise. I saw the bundle of papers in a careless \\nheap in front of his door. His right mitt was deep in his coat pocket. I saw the \\nfaint outline of maybe a skinny lead pipe, or a gun barrel. I gauged the moves \\nfor a heart stab to beat his mitt out of his pocket. \\n\\nI said, “Yeah Jack, what is it? I’m on the phone with my bondsman. The \\ncourt just raised my bond on a double-murder beef. I’m in a bad mood. I \\ndon’t want to buy anything.” \\n\\nHe just stood there like a scarfaced zombie staring at me. He looked down \\nat the carpet in front of my door. I looked down. A pink butterfly lay there \\nlike a silent indictment. \\n\\nHe heaved his chest and took a deep breath. It was like his last one. He \\nstooped and picked it up. The eerie bastard took his other hand out of his \\npocket. Tears rolled down from his unblinking orange eyes as he stared at \\nme. His scarred cheeks were quivering as he shredded the butterfly into pink \\nlint on the carpet. \\n\\nHe turned and walked away. I shut my door and got a beak load of cocaine. \\nI took the lounging robe off. It was dripping sweat. I showered. I sat in \\nChris’s chair at the window. Her sweet odor was still rising from it. For an \\nhour I heard a loud sobbing whine across the hall. It was Scarface chewing \\nout Chris. Mickey said midnight. I hadn’t eaten since morning and I wasn’t \\nhungry. Cocaine was a strong con for the belly. \\n\\nI thought, “I hope that jealous chump doesn’t croak her. It would be like \\nmaking a big bonfire out of hundred dollar bills. If she wasn’t his wife and I \\nhad a rod. I’d go over there and claim her.” \\n\\nThe phone rang. It was Silas. \\n\\nHe said, “What happened, kid? Was she a whiz in the sack? Did the joker \\ncatch her? I been busy. I ain’t had a chance to check with you until now. I \\nwas worried about you, kid. The broad told me she was late with the wire. I \\nstalled him in the cage.” \\n\\nI said, “It was very close, Silas. I’m a pimp, I didn’t stick her. I’ll take care \\n\\n\\n\\nof you and the broad this weekend when I pay my rent. Silas, if you get any \\nnews on the broad or Scarface wire me fast.” \\n\\nHe said, “Yeah, Kid, you know me. I stay hip to what goes on around here. \\nI’ll keep you plugged in, Kid. Good night. I’m going home.” \\n\\nI hung up and lay across the bed. I wondered if Max and Blondie had the \\nrunt hemmed up in an alley again. I smoked a reefer. I fell asleep. The phone \\nwoke me up. It was the runt. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, it’s your baby. It’s after two, can I come home?” I said, \\n“Bitch, what kinda lines you got?” \\n\\nShe said, “I got thirty slats. I’m beat. Daddy. My tricks have been spades. \\nYou know how cheap and hard they are to turn. Can I come in?” \\n\\nI said, “Come on in. Take a bath. Watch your jib, bitch. Don’t irritate me. \\nI’ve got a lot on my mind.” \\n\\nShe’d been working more than twelve hours. She was beat all right. Within \\na half hour after her bath she was snoring beside me. I was dozing when the \\nphone rang. I switched on the light. I picked up. \\n\\nI said, “Hello.” \\n\\nChris whispered, “Daddy, I can’t talk long. Leroy’s asleep. He found a \\nbutterfly that fell off my negligee. He’s been raving like a crazy man. He \\nknows I was over there. I got bad news for us. The band spot is out. He called \\nand turned it down. He’s going to keep the combo and go through Ohio. \\n\\n“His agent has a slew of one-nighters booked for him. He’s taking me with \\nhim. Daddy, I won’t forget us. I’ll keep in touch. Maybe he’ll go out before \\nwe leave tomorrow afternoon. I may get a chance to kiss you goodbye. I love \\nyou. Blood. I’m going to dream about Mr. Thriller until I—” \\n\\nI heard the drowsy whine of Leroy’s voice calling her name the instant \\nbefore she hung up. I turned and looked at the runt. Her big mouth was wide \\nopen. Frothy slobber ran down her chin. Her sour hair had started to kink at \\nthe edges. She needed to go to the beauty shop downstairs. \\n\\nI thought, “What kinda breaks am I getting? I’m sinfully good looking. I’m \\nlying here with a lather-mouth dog. The ugliest joker in the world is across \\nthe hall. He’s in the sack with a pretty bitch whose nose is wide open for me. \\nSomething’s gotta be done. Maybe after I cop Chris, I’ll have the brass ring \\nin my mitt.” \\n\\nI didn’t sleep at all after Chris called. The runt woke up at noon. She went \\nacross the street and got our lunch. At two in the afternoon she was in the \\nstreet. \\n\\n\\n\\nSilas called. He told me Chris was checking out. I saw Chris and Scarf ace \\nput their stuff in the car and drive away. \\n\\nThe runt came in at two a.m. with only twenty slats. She was shying away \\nfrom white tricks. She was leery of Max and Blondie. I couldn’t shake her \\nout of it. She would rather turn spades for three or five dollars. She was afraid \\nMax would catch her with a white trick. \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\nTHE UNWRITTEN BOOK \\n\\n\\nA week after Chris left I copped another bag of cocaine from Top. It was \\nalmost gone. The runt was only making expenses. I had one lonely C note \\nand a double saw plus the porker silver. The weather was getting balmy. I \\nneeded fresh clothes. I was going to the bottom fast. \\n\\nIn the three weeks after Chris left I kicked the runt’s ass a half dozen times. \\nI only left the hotel twice in almost a month. I was expecting Chris to call me \\nand say she was on her way to me. Things were getting worse. \\n\\nIt had been two weeks since I saw Top. I decided to call him. Maybe he \\ncould hip me to a new spot to work for runt. My bankroll was thin. At ten \\na.m. I called Top. One of his broads said he was out of town. He wouldn’t be \\nback for a week. \\n\\nI got a sudden thought. I asked her if she knew Sweet’s phone number. She \\nsaid she did, but she’d have to call and find out if Sweet wanted me to have \\nit. She called back in ten minutes and gave it to me. I called him. He \\nanswered. He was in a good mood. \\n\\nHe said, “Well, whatta you know, if it ain’t grinning Slim. You still got \\nthat one whore or have you grinned yourself whoreless?” \\n\\nI looked over at the runt. She was still asleep. She hadn’t been in the street \\nfor three days. Her period had run five days. She claimed she was too weak \\nand sick to go out. I had given her a terrible whipping the night before. I \\nneeded advice badly. \\n\\nI said, “Sweet, my bitch is falling apart. She’s playing dead. If you don’t \\npull my coat I’m gonna starve to death. You gotta help me Sweet.” \\n\\nHe said, “Nigger, you ain’t cracking to nick me for scratch are you? I don’t \\nloan my scratch to suckers who got whores and can’t pimp on ’em. I ain’t \\ngonna support you and that lazy bitch.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “No Sweet I don’t want scratch. I want you to run the game through \\nmy skull. I got a tiny bit of scratch. I gotta get my coat pulled before I tap \\nout.” \\n\\nHe said, “You got wheels? You know how to get out here? Now remember \\nyou get a roust out here, crack my name. Don’t repeat your boner.” \\n\\nI said, “Yeah, I’m driving. I think I can find you pad. When should I come \\nout there?” \\n\\nHe said, “Quick as you can get here. You get here and grin in my face. I’m \\ngonna throw you over the patio wall. \\n\\n“Say kid. Peaches and me got a taste for some of that barbecued chicken \\ndown there in Hell. Bring one with you when you come.” \\n\\nHe hung up. My ticker was pounding like Chris had walked in the door \\nnaked with a million dollars. I shook the runt. She opened her eyes. I stood \\nover her. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, you better be in the street when I get back.” \\n\\nShe said, “You can’t do anything but kill me. I’m ready to die. I don’t care \\nwhat you do to me. I’m sick.” \\n\\nI said, “All right bitch, just hip me where you want your black stinking ass \\nshipped.” \\n\\nI got in the Ford. I realized I hadn’t put on a tie. I didn’t have a lid. I \\nlooked into the rear-view mirror. I sure looked scroungy. Maybe he’d be \\nalone. Then I remembered the lobby. What the hell did it matter. \\n\\nI drove for about fifteen minutes before I saw a clean open barbeque joint. \\nA black stud in a tall white cap was stabbing chickens onto a turning spit in \\nthe window. I went in. I came out with two birds. Peaches might be really \\nhungry for barbequed chicken. It made solid sense to brown-nose Miss \\nPeaches. \\n\\nAfter making several wrong turns I found Sweet’s building. I parked the \\nFord in almost the same spot at the curb where Satan had sapped me a month \\nago. A young white stud in a monkey suit was out in front. Crusader Sweet \\nwas doing his bit to reverse the social order. \\n\\nI went to the desk in the lobby. I felt like a tramp as I waited for the pass. I \\ngot on the elevator. A different broad was at the controls. The spicy scent of \\nthe chicken wiggled her nose. She wasn’t as pretty as the ripe-smelling broad. \\nShe sure kept her crotch from advertising. Maybe it was just that she didn’t \\nget heavy action. \\n\\nI stepped from the cage. The friendly brown snake wasn’t at his station to \\n\\n\\n\\nflop his mop for me. I figured it was his off day. The odds were a hundred to \\none he was in the sack somewhere with a six-foot blonde. \\n\\nShe was probably a little like the blonde coming up from the pit on her \\nway to the cage. It was Mimi. She flicked her green eyes across my face. \\nThey were cold as a frozen French lake. She passed me. She looked like a \\nfancy French pastry in her sable stole. I wondered how I got the stupid \\ncourage to turn down her freak off. \\n\\nI walked to the doorway of the pit. The stone broad was still in her \\nsquirting squat. Sweet was sitting on the couch. Miss Peaches beside him saw \\nme first. She bounded across the carpet. I felt her choppers graze my hand. \\nShe snatched the bag of chicken. She flung it on the alabaster topped cocktail \\ntable in front of Sweet. \\n\\nSweet looked at me. I tightened my face into a solemn grim mask. I \\nstepped down and walked toward him. He was wearing only a pair of polka- \\ndot shorts. In daylight I noticed a mole on the broad in the picture over the \\ncouch. \\n\\nI said, “Hello Mr. Jones. I hope those birds are still warm.” \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, your map sure looks like that bullshit bitch you got is been \\nshooting you through hot grease. I like that look you got today. Maybe you’re \\ngetting hip the pimp game ain’t for grinning jackasses. \\n\\n“Get over here and sit on this couch. While baby and me eat our barbeque, \\nrundown you and your whore. I wanta know where and how you copped her. \\nTell me everything you can remember about her and what’s happened since \\nyou copped her. Rundown your whole life as far back as you remember. It \\ndon’t matter which is first.” \\n\\nI ran down my life for him. Then I ran down from the night I met the runt \\nuntil the moment I left the Haven. It took maybe forty-five minutes. I even \\ndescribed the runt in detail. \\n\\nSweet and his greedy girl-friend had devoured both birds down to the bare \\nbones. Sweet was wiping Miss Peaches’ whiskers with a paper napkin. She \\nput her head in his lap. She was jammed against my thigh. Sweet leaned back \\non the couch. He put his bare feet on the top of the cocktail table. \\n\\nHe said, “Sweetheart, you’re black like me. I love you. You got the hate to \\npimp. You a lucky Nigger to get your coat pulled by me. You flap your horns \\nand remember what I’m gonna spiel to you. \\n\\n“There are thousands of Niggers in this country who think they’re pimps. \\nThe pussy-weak white pimps ain’t worth mentioning. Don’t none of them \\n\\n\\n\\npimp by the book. They ain’t even heard about it. If they was black, they’d \\nstarve stiff. \\n\\n“There ain’t more than six of ’em who are hip to and pimp by the book. \\nYou won’t find it in the square-Nigger or white history books. The truth is \\nthat book was written in the skulls of proud slick Niggers freed from slavery. \\nThey wasn’t lazy. They was puking sick of picking white man’s cotton and \\nkissing his nasty ass. The slave days stuck in their skulls. They went to the \\ncities. They got hip fast. \\n\\n“The conning bastard white man hadn’t freed the Niggers. The cities was \\nlike the plantations down South. Jeffing Uncle Toms still did all the white \\nman’s hard and filthy work. \\n\\n“Those slick Nigger heroes bawled like crumb crushers. They saw the \\nwhite man just like on the plantations still ramming it into the finest black \\nbroads. \\n\\n“The broads were stupid squares. They still freaked for free with the white \\nman. They wasn’t hip to the scratch in their hot black asses. \\n\\n“Those first Nigger pimps started hipping the dumb bitches to the gold \\nmines between their legs. They hipped them to stick their mitts out for the \\nwhite man’s scratch. The first Nigger pimps and sure-shot gamblers was the \\nonly Nigger big shots in the country. \\n\\n“They wore fine threads and had blooded horses. Those pimps was black \\ngeniuses. They wrote that skull book on pimping. Even now if it wasn’t for \\nthat frantic army of white tricks, Nigger pimps would starve to death. \\n\\n“Greenie, the white man has been pig-greedy for Nigger broads ever since \\nhis first whiff of black pussy. Black whores con themselves the only reason \\nhe sniffs his way to ’em is white broads ain’t got what it takes to please him. \\n\\n“I’m hip he’s got two other secret sick reasons. White women ain’t hip to \\nhis secret reasons. The dumb white broads ain’t even hip to why he locks all \\nNiggers inside tight stockades. He’d love it if the Nigger broads wasn’t \\nlocked in there. The white man is scared shitless. He don’t want them \\nhumping bucks coming out there in the white world rubbing their bellies \\nagainst those soft white bellies. \\n\\n“That’s the real reason for keeping all the Niggers locked up. To show you \\nhow sick in the head he is, he thinks black broads are dirt beneath his feet. \\nHis balls will bust if he don’t sneak through that stockade, to those half¬ \\nsavage, less than human, black broads. \\n\\n“You know, Greenie, why he’s gotta come to ’em? The silly sick bastard is \\n\\n\\n\\nlike a whore that needs and loves punishment. He’s a joke with scratch in his \\nmitt. As great as he thinks he is, he can’t keep his beak and swipe outta the \\nstink of a black ass. \\n\\n“He wallows and stains himself. The poor freak’s joy is in his suffering. \\nThe chump believes he’s done something dirty to himself. He slips back into \\nhis white world. He goes on conning himself he’s God and Niggers are wild \\nfilthy animals he has to keep in the stockades. \\n\\n“The sad thing is, he don’t even know he’s sick in the skull. Greenie, I’m \\npulling your coat from the bottom to the top. That rundown on the first \\nNigger pimps will make you proud to be a pimp. \\n\\n“Square-ass Niggers will try to put shame inside you. Ain’t one of ’em \\nwouldn’t suck a mule’s ass to pimp. They can’t because a square ain’t \\nnothing but a pussy. He lets a square bitch pimp on him. You gotta pimp by \\nthe rules of that pimp book those noble studs wrote a hundred years ago. \\nWhen you look in a mirror you gotta know that cold-hearted bastard looking \\nat you is real. \\n\\n“Now that young bitch you got is gone lazy. She’s stuffing on you. That \\nbitch ain’t sick. I ain’t never seen a bitch under twenty that could get sick. \\nYour whore is bullshitting. A whore’s scratch ain’t never longer than a \\npimp’s cold game. You gotta have strict rules for a whore. She’s gotta respect \\nyou to hump her heart out in the street. \\n\\n“One whore ain’t got but one pussy and one jib. You got to get what there \\nis in her fast as you can. You gotta get sixteen hours a day outta her. There \\nain’t no guarantee you going to keep any bitch for long. The name of the \\npimp game is ‘Cop and Blow.’ \\n\\n“Now this young bitch you git is shitty all right. She knows you ain’t got \\nno other whore. I want you to go back to that hotel. Make that bitch get outta \\nthat bed and get in the street. Put your foot in her ass hard. If that don’t work, \\ntake a wire coat hanger and twist it into a whip. Ain’t no bitch, freak or not, \\ncan stand up to that hanger. \\n\\n“Maybe your foot and fist can’t move that young whore anymore. She’s a \\nfreak to them. Believe me, Greenie, that coat hanger will blow her or \\nstraighten her out. It’s better to have no whore than a piece of whore. Get \\nsome cotton and make her pack herself. The show can’t stop when a whore \\nbleeds. \\n\\n“I’m gonna lay some pills on you. Give her a couple when you get her \\noutta that bed. Don’t give her anymore reefer. It makes some whores lazy. \\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t worry, kid, if you do like I say and blow her. I’ll give you a whore. \\nKid, don’t hold that whore to one block. Tell that whore all the streets go. \\nTurn her loose. It’s the only way to pimp. If she blows, whatta you lost. She \\nstands up, you got a whore and some real scratch. \\n\\n“You go back and put the coat-hanger pressure on her. If it don’t blow her \\nand she stands up for a week, you ought to have half a grand in a week. Take \\nthat scratch and drive to one of the whore towns close around. Go to Western \\nUnion. Send that scratch back to yourself at your hotel. Use some broad’s \\nname as the sender. \\n\\n“That lazy bitch you got will think she’s got competition. Watch the sparks \\nfly from her ass. She’ll try to top that bitch that doesn’t exist. Greenie, you \\nlisten to Sweet Jones. You’ll be a helluva pimp. \\n\\n“Never get friendly and confide in your whores. You got twenty whores, \\ndon’t forget your thoughts are secret. A good pimp is always really alone. \\nYou gotta always be a puzzle, a mystery to them. That’s how you hold a \\nwhore. Don’t get sour. Tell them something new and confusing every day. \\nYou can hold ’em as long as you can do it. \\n\\n“Sweet is hipping you to pimp by the book. I’m the greatest Nigger pimp \\nin the world. Now Greenie, is your skull going to hold everything I told \\nyou?” \\n\\nI said, “Thirty years from now I’ll still remember every word. Sweet you \\nwon’t be sorry you helped me. I’m gonna pimp my black ass off. I’ll make \\nyou proud of me. I’ll call you later and hip you to what the runt did under \\nhanger pressure. Oh yeah, don’t forget to give me those pills.” \\n\\nHe got up. Miss Peaches stretched her legs. She jumped down and \\nfollowed him. A sharp hooked nail in one of her rear claws snagged out an \\ninch of cloth from my pants knee. I wouldn’t have cared if she had clawed \\nme naked. I was in a thrilled daze. With Sweet Jones on ready tap to pull my \\ncoat I was going to set a record on the fast track. \\n\\nSweet came back. He gave me a tiny bottle of small white pills. He put his \\nhands on my shoulders. He looked down at me. His subzero eyes warmed to \\nmaybe zero. \\n\\nHe said, “I love you, Sweetheart! You know kid, I don’t ever think I’m \\ngonna grin in your face. I love you like a son. Any time I grin in a sucker’s \\nface I’m gonna cross him or croak him. Call me any time you need a \\nrundown. Good luck, Greenie.” \\n\\nI walked across the pit. I stepped up to the doorway. I glanced back. Sweet \\n\\n\\n\\nhad Peaches in his arms. She was purring like a new bride. Sweet was \\nsqueezing her in a lover’s embrace. He was covering her laughing face with \\nkisses. \\n\\nI checked Mickey when I got in the Ford. It was four p.m. I drove toward \\nthe runt. I tromped hard on the gas pedal. \\n\\nI thought, “No wonder Sweet is the greatest Nigger pimp in the world. He \\neven knows the history of the black pimp. \\n\\n“I ain’t going to spare the runt’s ass. I’m gonna go right in with the \\npressure. I hope she’s not in the street. Sweet promised me a whore if I blow \\nthe runt. Any whore of Sweet’s is already trained to a fine edge. Maybe he’ll \\ngive me Mimi.” \\n\\n\\n\\n11 \\n\\nTO LOSE A WHORE \\n\\n\\nI pulled the Ford into the curb across the street from the Haven. I didn’t see \\nthe runt anywhere in the street. I peeped into the greasy spoon. She wasn’t at \\nthe counter. I looked up at our window. I crossed the street and went through \\nthe lobby. I took the stairs to the fourth floor. I made three stabs at the lock \\nwith the key before I made it. I stepped inside. I was excited. I chain-bolted \\nthe door. I walked to the bedroom. \\n\\nThe runt was propped up in bed smoking a stick of gangster. Lady Day \\nwas tar brushing that mean, sweet man again. I stood by the side of the bed, \\nnext to the record player. I saw the edge of a paper plate sticking out of the \\nwastebasket. I took it out and put it on the bed. \\n\\nTwo navy beans were in a puddle of grease on the side of the plate. A pile \\nof sucked, cleaned neck bones were heaped in the center of it. The runt had \\ngone out to the greasy spoon and copped a hearty meal. She sure had a \\nhealthy appetite for a sick bitch. Her eyes were wild and big, looking up at \\nme. \\n\\nShe fingered gently at the hole in my pants knee. I shut the box off. I \\nripped the record off the turntable. I broke it in half and hurled the pieces into \\nthe wastebasket. She kept her eyes on the hole at my knee. She ignored the \\nbroken record. She played it cool. \\n\\nShe said, “You’ll have to get it rewoven, huh? Daddy, I’m feeling better. I \\nfelt good enough to go across the street for food. Maybe by tomorrow I’ll feel \\ngood enough to go in the street. Baby, I would’ve went out after I ate, but my \\nlegs were too weak.” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I already passed the death sentence on you. It’s good you \\nhad your last meal. I’m gonna send your dead ass to your daughter. Gay. \\nTake off that gown and lie on your belly, bitch.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI went to the closet. I took down a wire hanger. I straightened it into one \\nlong piece. I doubled and braided it. I wrapped a necktie around the handle \\nend. I turned back to the bed. She was still propped in the bed. Her mouth \\nwas gaped open. She had both her hands clapped over her chest. \\n\\nShe was like a broad in a movie. She opens a door and there’s Dr. Jekyll \\njust going into his frightful change. I saw her tongue tremble inside her jib. \\nHer lips made a liquid plopping sound as they mutely pounded together. She \\nrolled across the bed away from me. I raised my right arm up and back. I \\nheard my shoulder socket creak. \\n\\nHer gown was hiked up to her waist. Her naked rear end had scrambled to \\nthe far edge of the bed. I raced around the foot of the bed. She rolled to the \\nmiddle. She was on her back. Her arms held her jack-knifed legs against her \\nchest. \\n\\nThe whites of her eyes glowed like phosphorus. I brought the wire whip \\ndown. I heard it swish through the air. It struck her across the shin bones. She \\ncried out like she was celebrating New Year’s Eve. \\n\\nShe screamed, “Ooh-whee! Ooh-whee!” \\n\\nShe jerked flat, rigid on the bed then smalled her fists against her temples. \\nShe sucked her bottom lip up into her jib. I slashed the air again. It sounded \\nlike maybe a dum-dum bullet striking across her gut button. \\n\\nShe moaned, “Whee-Lordy! Whee-Lordy!” \\n\\nShe turned over on her belly. I tore the gown from her back. She was \\nnaked. She flailed her arms like a holy-roller. The whip whistled a deadly \\nlyric as I brought it down again and again across her back and butt. I saw the \\nawful welts puffing the black velvet skin. \\n\\nI stopped and turned her over. The pillow stuck to her face. I snatched it \\naway. There was a ripping sound. I saw feathers sticking to her tear wet face. \\nShe had chewed a hole in the pillow. She was thrashing her legs and \\nmumbling. \\n\\nHer chest heaved in great sobs. She was staring at me and shaking her \\nskull. Her eyes had that pitiful look of Christ’s on those paintings of the \\nCrucifixion. Her lips were moving. I got on the bed. I stuck my ear near. \\n\\nShe whispered, “I don’t need any more whipping. I give, Daddy. You’re \\nthe boss. I was a dumb bitch. It looks like you got a whore now. Kiss me and \\nhelp me up.” \\n\\nI felt tears roll down my cheeks. Maybe I was crying in joy that I broke her \\nspirit. I felt sorry for her. I wondered if I was falling in love like a sucker. I \\n\\n\\n\\nkissed her hard. I carried her into the bathroom. I placed her tenderly in the \\ntub. \\n\\nI turned the water on. A stream burst from the shower nozzle overhead. \\nShe squealed. I pushed in the shower bypass on the tub faucet. The warm \\nwater started filling the tub. I dumped a bottle of rubbing alcohol into the tub. \\n\\nShe looked up at me. I took the tiny bottle of pills out of my pocket. I \\nshook out two into my palm. I took a glass off the face bowl. I handed her the \\npills. She put them in her mouth. She washed them down with the glass of \\nwater I gave her. \\n\\nI said, “Phyllis, why do you make your sweet daddy mean? Daddy’s gonna \\nkill his little bitch if she don’t straighten up and whore like the star she is. \\n\\n“Bitch, lie down in that water for a while. Then get in the street and get \\nsome real scratch for your man. You don’t have to stay in this block. Just \\nwalk and work until you get respectable scratch to bring in. I can raise you if \\nyou take a fall. They gotta let you make a phone call. If I go out I’ll check the \\ndesk here by phone every hour or so. Bitch, get down and star. You want \\nyour man, get him some real scratch.” \\n\\nI went and sat on the bed. The sheet looked like a red zebra had lain down \\nand his stripes had faded on it. I heard her sloshing the water in the tub. She \\nwas humming the record I’d smashed. Sweet’s pills sure weren’t hurting her. \\n\\nWhores are strange people all right. She was silent while she combed her \\nhair and fixed her face. She put on a red knit suit. She stood in front of me. \\nShe held her hand out. I saw dark stains on her stockings at the shins. Her \\neyes were bright. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I don’t have a dime. Give me a coupla dollars, please. \\nDon’t worry, when I come in I’ll have nice scratch.” \\n\\nI stood up. I gave her a fin. I walked to the door with her. She turned her \\nface up. I leaned down. I sucked her bottom lip, then bit it hard. She squeezed \\nmy arm and gouged her teeth into my cheek. She went down the hall. \\n\\nI shut the door and went to the front window. I rubbed my cheek to see if \\nthe skin was broken. I saw her cross the street at the corner. She was walking \\nfast. That whipping and those pills had made her well. She looked like a \\nchild. She was so tiny and sexy in her red suit. I wondered as she disappeared \\nwhether she’d come back. It was seven p.m. \\n\\nI thought, “I better stick here in the pad. Whipping a broad with a hanger is \\nnot a bit like a foot in the ass. Christ! I’d kill the bastard on the spot if he hit \\nmy bare ass with one. Sweet was right. She got outta that bed all right. I \\n\\n\\n\\nwonder if those slavery pimps invented the hanger whip. \\n\\n“No, even hangers hadn’t been invented then. I guess Sweet did. I’m gonna \\nwait the runt out. If she tries to slip in here to steal her clothes. I’ll croak her. \\nI wonder why Chris hasn’t gotten in touch? Maybe some fast pimp has \\nalready stolen that pretty bitch from Leroy. Maybe Leroy had one of his fits \\nand croaked her. \\n\\n“I wonder what the bitch will be like that I get from Sweet if the runt \\nblows? This is a hell of a feeling I got. I don’t know if I got a whore or not. It \\nwould be a bitch if Sweet goes back on his word and leaves me whoreless on \\nthis fast track. I’m gonna get high. I’d better take the flight with gangster. \\nCocaine will only sharpen my grief.” \\n\\nI took a shower. I stepped out of the tub. I got a towel from the wall rack. I \\nsaw splotches of red on the one beside it. I toweled off. I rolled a giant \\nbomber. I put a fresh case on the pillow the runt had gnawed. \\n\\nI propped myself against the head of the bed. I sucked the bomber down to \\na “roach.” The reefer and the sibilant murmuring of tires against the street \\nlulled me into deep sleep. \\n\\nI woke up. I was still half-propped against the pillows. It was broad \\ndaylight. The runt hadn’t come in. I had blown whoreless with that wire \\nhanger. I lit a cigarette. It was seven a.m. I lay there staring at the entwined \\nlovers on the “Kiss” Statue. \\n\\nI thought, “The runt’s got a pair of tits like that broad. Jeez, she was sure a \\nfreak. Some pimp is going to have a sweet bitch when he straightens her out. \\nI wonder if that little bitch will miss me? She damn sure can’t forget me. \\n\\n“Hell, I can’t worry about the mule going blind. I’ll wait until noon or so. \\nI’ll rip open that whore grab-bag Sweet promised me. Maybe I was hasty to \\nshut the door on Melody and his entasis. At this point I can get hip to \\nanything except work. No one could know I was freaking with a stud. \\n\\n“Christ, I wish beautiful Chris would call. What a thrill if she’d tell me she \\nwas rushing to me. To get her tight I’d maybe eat everything but the tacks in \\nher shoes. I’m hungry. I’m not going to let my troubles abuse my skull and \\nmy belly.” \\n\\nI got Silas on the phone. I ordered home fries and sausage. I got up and \\nbrushed my teeth. I skull-noted to call Top when he got back in town. Maybe \\nhe could find out who booked Leroy. Maybe I’d trace Chris that way. I’d get \\nPreston’s owl-head and take her from Leroy at gunpoint. \\n\\nI was listening to “Mood Indigo” and thinking about the runt. I was \\n\\n\\n\\nremembering that day when I left Mama crying at the window. \\n\\nI couldn’t wait to get around the corner to the runt. Then I was sure I had a \\nblack gold mine sitting in the Ford waiting for me. In this tough pimp game \\nyou couldn’t count your scratch until you had it in your mitt. Holding whores \\nwas like trying to cinch-grip quicksilver. \\n\\nI thought, “Poor Mama. I haven’t called her or anything. I’m gonna call \\nher when things get straight.” \\n\\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\nTO GAIN A STABLE \\n\\n\\nI heard Silas knock on the door. I went and opened it. Silas was a strange, \\nbeautiful sight. The slick sorcerer-bastard had my breakfast on a tray. He had \\nturned himself into a cute black bitch in a red knit suit. It was the runt. I \\nmurdered the grin of relief in its jib womb. I twisted my face into a copy of \\nSweet’s when he bounced my skull off his John wall. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I’m gonna croak you. Since three o’clock I been calling all \\nthe hospitals and jails in town. I even called the morgue. Speak up bitch, \\nwhat’s your story?” \\n\\nShe looked up at me. She was smiling. She walked past me into the \\nbedroom. I followed her. She sat the tray on the dresser. She ran her fingers \\ndeep into her bosom. She brought out a damp wad of bills. She gave it to me. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, my last trick was a fifty slat, all night trick. I caught him \\nat two this morning. Baby, I gave you a hundred and twenty eight slats. \\n\\n“Silas had your breakfast on the elevator on my way up. With the two slats \\nI gave him, I made a hundred and thirty. \\n\\n“Oh, Daddy, I’ve found some good streets to work a coupla miles from \\nhere. It’s in the neighborhood of a joint called the Roost. You were a sweet \\ndaddy to be worried about your baby. Oh! I almost forgot. Keep your fingers \\ncrossed. I may bring you a girl one of these mornings. She’s wild about me. \\nHer old man ain’t nothing. He’s a burglar.” \\n\\nI said, “Phyllis, there’s more than one note in a song. You gotta string \\ntogether a thousand nights like last night. Now take a bath. I’m gonna treat \\nthose scratches. Remember I don’t want any junkie bitch. Make sure she’s \\nclean before you cop.” \\n\\nI forgot about my breakfast. I went out and got into the Ford. I drove to the \\ndrugstore and got ointments and salves. \\n\\n\\n\\nI called Sweet and told him the runt stood up. He reminded me to send that \\nscratch to myself as soon as possible. I went back to the Haven. I sent Silas \\nfor hot food. I dressed her wounds. They sure looked bad. \\n\\nThose “go” pills she had taken died. She fell asleep while I was doctoring \\nher back. I ate and took a nap. By the end of the week, I felt like a pimp. I \\nhad an eight-bill bankroll not counting the porker silver. \\n\\nOne night about nine I got into the Ford. I drove less than a hundred miles \\nto Terre Haute a small whore-town. I sent five bills to myself at the Haven. I \\nused Christine as the broad’s name. \\n\\nTop was back in town so I stopped on the way home and copped cocaine, \\nyellows, and bennies. The runt came in that morning around four. She had a \\nhundred-and-five slats. She was on her way to stardom. We were in bed when \\nI cracked on her. \\n\\nI said, “Baby, I think our luck is changing all around. I’m pretty sure \\nDaddy’s copped another whore. I met her in a bar about a week ago. \\n\\n“It’s a small world all right. She said she just moved out of this joint not \\nlong ago. She went wild over me. She’s a fine young bitch. She begged me to \\ngo to Terre Haute with her. She’s working a fast house up there. I told her I’d \\nrun up there after she sent her first week’s scratch. She gave me her phone \\nnumber up there. I gave her my address. \\n\\n“Tonight I called up there. I asked her about my scratch. She told me five \\nbills were on the way. Baby, if she’s jiving we ain’t hurt. If she sends it and \\nit’s respectable scratch your daddy’s got a small stable.” \\n\\nShe said, “Is she a white bitch? What does the bitch look like?” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, don’t get shitty now. What’s wrong with a white broad \\nhelping two spades? She’s a boot. She looks like what she is. A scratch¬ \\ngetting fine bitch in love with your man at first sight.” \\n\\nIt was a little after noon when the messenger brought the scratch notice. \\nThe runt went to the door and brought him into the bedroom. \\n\\nI opened it. The office was a half-mile away. I asked the runt if she’d like \\nsome air. She was eager to go. \\n\\nIt was a good thing I had gotten that driver’s license. I had to go through a \\nlong routine. They even made me crack the amount I was expecting. I got the \\ncash. \\n\\nThe runt was silent on the way home. Sweet sure knew the angles to put \\npressure on a whore’s skull. In the next month I made two more trips to Terre \\nHaute. Twice I went across town and stayed in a hotel over night until around \\n\\n\\n\\nnoon. I was conning the runt I was visiting her stable mate. \\n\\nThe runt was really humping. She was averaging no less than a bill a night. \\nTwo months after the hanger whipping I took a furnished three-bedroom \\nvacancy in Top’s building. It was a gold-andred dream after the Haven. The \\nrunt really freaked this pad off. I guess she felt at home at last. It was on the \\nsixth floor. \\n\\nI copped six two-hundred-dollar vines at sixty slats a piece. The booster \\nlived on the second floor beneath me. The same week Top cut me into a stud \\nwho had a black LaSalle car in mint condition. \\n\\nHe was out on an appeal bond and his lip wired him he was joint bound. I \\ngave the stud four bills in his mitt. I paid off the last two notes on the wheels. \\n\\nI had two cars. I gave the runt her Ford back. She could cover and get \\ndown in a wider area. \\n\\nI started hanging around out at Sweet’s pad, sucking up the pimp game. I \\ngot home from Sweet’s one morning around five. I heard the runt rapping to \\nsomeone in one of the bedrooms. I pushed the door open. The runt was in bed \\nwith a tall, pretty brown-skin broad. She looked fifteen. They were naked. \\nThey stopped kissing and looked at me. \\n\\nThe runt said, “Daddy this is Ophelia. I told you about her in the Haven. \\nHer old man got one-to-three in the joint for burglary. She wants to join our \\nfamily. Can she?” \\n\\nI said, “Ophelia, if you’re not full of shit and you obey my rules you’re \\nwelcome. Have you bitches been in the streets working tonight? I hope you \\njust got in that bed to freak off. Phyllis, get outta that bed and get my double¬ \\naction scratch.” \\n\\nThe runt went into the closet and brought me a roll of bills. \\n\\nShe said, “A bill of this I made.” \\n\\nI fast counted a yard and seventy-five slats. I took off my clothes and got \\nbetween them. I spent an hour quizzing Ophelia and running down my rules. \\nShe was eighteen. The circus started. I was circus master. I had become too \\nmuch pimp to freak off with a new package. They were the performers. She \\nhad put only six bits in my pocket. How cheaply did she get me if she blew \\ntomorrow. \\n\\nIt was the night before my twentieth birthday in August. I had gone to the \\nWest Side to cop some dresses for Phyllis and Ophelia. I had left the \\nbooster’s pad. I was loading the dozen or so pieces in the trunk of the \\nLaSalle. I slammed the trunk lid shut and locked it. \\n\\n\\n\\nI heard screaming and smashing sounds coming from a cabaret just down \\nthe street. I saw a hatless, gray-haired man come staggering to the sidewalk. \\nHe was holding his head. The side of his head looked shiny. I walked down \\nthe sidewalk toward him. \\n\\nHe was bleeding from a deep cut in his head. He was moaning and trying \\nto stop the flow of blood with his hands. A dark thin joker ran out behind the \\nold man. I saw something gleam in his hand as he raised his arm again and \\nagain. \\n\\nI moved closer. The thin joker was savagely pistol whipping the old stud. \\nHe was beaten to his knees. He looked like someone had painted his face red. \\n\\nThe thin joker turned his face. The light coming from the open door of the \\ncabaret shone on it. It was Chris’ Leroy beating the old man. Twenty \\ncustomers had come out. They formed a circle around the massacre. I moved \\nto the outside of the circle. \\n\\nThen I saw Chris standing on the other side of the circle. She was \\nscreaming and tugging at Leroy’s pistol arm. Leroy had gone insane. \\n\\nI moved around the circle closer to Chris. I stood behind her. I saw greasy \\nstains on the back of her dress collar. Her hair looked frowsy and dull. \\nScarface was sure taking her to the dogs. I heard the screech of brakes. I saw \\ntwo huge white rollers muscle through the crowd. Leroy was astraddle the \\nunconscious figure, still pounding his pistol against it. \\n\\nThey shoved Chris backward. One of them put an armlock on Leroy’s gun \\narm and took the pistol. The other vised his neck in a strangle hold. They \\ndragged him to the prowl car and threw him into the back seat. \\n\\nA short middle-aged white broad stepped to the side of the fallen figure. \\nShe was wringing her hands. She was wearing a bar apron. She stooped and \\nstroked the figure’s brow. \\n\\nOne of them got on the front seat. He turned sideways guarding Leroy. He \\nput a microphone to his lips. He was calling an ambulance, no doubt. The \\nother roller came back and stopped beside the white woman. \\n\\nHe said, “Anybody you know?” \\n\\nShe sobbed. “Yes, he’s my father-in-law.” \\n\\nHe said, “What happened?” \\n\\nShe said, “Everybody knows Papa Tony loves to kid around the girls. He’s \\ngot a heart as big as New York. Everybody loves and understands him. Papa \\nTony came in the bar. He started kissing the cheek of all the girls at the bar. \\n\\n“He kissed that one behind you. That maniac man of hers stopped singing. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe leaped off the stage. He started to beat poor Papa Tony with his pistol. It’s \\nthe first night the maniac has worked for my husband. If my husband, Vince, \\nhad been here that jerk’s brains would splatter the sidewalk.” \\n\\nThe roller looked back at Chris. He started making notes in a small book. I \\nknew he’d quiz her after he got the full picture. I touched Chris lightly on the \\nshoulder. She turned and looked up at me. She got weak in the knees. She \\nslumped against me. I took her arm and steered her down the sidewalk. I \\nheard the distant whine of an ambulance siren. \\n\\nI said, “Chris, you had better split. That’s a white man Leroy beat up. The \\nwhite folks are going to cross you into it. After all you’re the reason he \\nnipped.” \\n\\nWe got into the La Salle. I moved it down the street toward the prowl car. I \\nput on the brakes. A couple came from in front of the prowl car. They crossed \\nthe street in front of me. I had stopped beside the prowl car. Chris could have \\nreached out and touched it. \\n\\nI turned my head and looked into the rear seat of the prowl car. Leroy was \\nstaring at Chris. His eyes shifted to me. He leaped toward the front seat. The \\nroller backhanded him. I saw Leroy’s head dip out of sight as I pulled away. \\n\\nI made from that frantic leap of his that he remembered me. The LaSalle \\nmoved quickly away from the West Side. Chris was crying. I stayed silent \\nuntil I hit the fringe of the South Side. \\n\\nThen I said, “All right, Chris, I got you away from the heat. Tell me where \\nyou live and I’ll take you home. Don’t cry. You can bail him out when they \\nbook him.” \\n\\nShe sobbed, “All right, you want to take me home? Turn around and take \\nme to Leroy’s jalopy. It’s parked behind the bar where he blew his silly top. \\n\\n“We got in town broke this afternoon. He didn’t get the settlement. Maybe \\nhe’ll never get it. I’m so disgusted. He was to get paid nightly for the gig. He \\ndoes a blues singing bit now.” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, you look like a bum. You conned me you’d keep in touch. \\nYou were gonna be my whore, remember? I shoulda left you back there to go \\nto jail with your sucker-man.” \\n\\nI realized I had a solid chance to cop her now. All I had to do was stay \\nstrong and bluff her. \\n\\nLeroy was a cinch to get a bit. He couldn’t make bail. Chris had no out but \\nme. She sure looked like my third whore. \\n\\nI coasted into the curb. I left the engine running. We were parked in front \\n\\n\\n\\nof a fleabag hotel. I had maybe a twenty-five-hundred-slat roll in my pocket I \\nflashed for her. I peeled off a saw buck. I held it toward her. She ignored it. \\n\\nShe said, “Blood, it wasn’t that I didn’t think about you. I wanted to call \\nyou. I wanted to keep my word. Leroy never let me out of his sight. He would \\neven follow me to the toilet. You don’t know how much I hate him. I hope he \\ngets life. Don’t cut me loose. Blood. I’ll keep my promises. I’m free now. I’m \\nyours, baby. Tell me to jump in the river. I’ll do it.” \\n\\nI said, “No Chris, I’m afraid of you. I think Leroy has made a tramp jive- \\nbitch outta you. I’m pimping too good to bring a headache into the stable. I’ll \\nalways be your friend, Chris. My ticker is bleeding for you, baby. I gotta \\nthink of number one. \\n\\n“My whores are humping sixteen hours a day in the street. They love it. I \\ndon’t figure you got the guts and heart for the street track. \\n\\n“Chris, for the rest of my life I’ll be sad when I think of you. I’ll have a \\nlump in my throat when I think of what might have been. Take this saw buck, \\nbaby, and the best of luck always. Goodbye, Chris. Please split before I get \\nweak and let you be my whore.” \\n\\nI reached across her and opened the car door. My skull was hitting on all \\nhundred-and-seventy-five cylinders. I was cinching her. \\n\\nI remembered her name, Christine, on those Terre Haute money orders I’d \\nbeen sending myself. She was the runt’s ghost gadfly come to life. \\n\\nShe pulled the door shut. She hurled herself against me. She held on to me \\nand wailed like maybe I was her dead mama on the way back to the grave \\nafter a brief visit. \\n\\nShe blubbered, “Blood, please don’t cut me loose. I’m not a lazy bitch. \\nGive me a chance. I want to amount to something. Please take me with you. I \\nwon’t let you down. I can hold my own against any bitch.” \\n\\nI pulled out. I was headed home. I was a fox with a rare, pretty hen in my \\njib. I knew the runt and Ophelia were in the street. In the trunk I had six \\ndresses I’d copped for Ophelia. I was sure they’d fit Chris. \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I’m gonna gamble on you. I’m taking you to your new pad. \\nYou gotta understand one thing. You can’t bring in scratch under a bill a \\nnight. You do, I may light my cigarettes with it or use it to wipe my ass. \\n\\n“You’re gonna meet and work in the street tonight with your sisters. I’m \\ngonna give you a rundown. Flap your horns and remember it. It will bring \\nyou into the family with some stardust on your tail. \\n\\n“Chris, you’re lucky. A whore of mine croaked in Terre Haute just a week \\n\\n\\n\\nago. Her heart stopped while she was turning a trick. She was a martyr. Her \\nname was Christine. I went up there and blew a coupla grand on her funeral. \\n\\n“I guess I felt guilty about blowing all that scratch on a broad I’d had for \\nonly a coupla months or so. I didn’t tell the stable about her death. Maybe I \\nwent all out on her funeral because she had your name. \\n\\n“I just don’t know. Anyway, the stable never met her. They sure have a lot \\nof respect for that long scratch she sent me every week from the whorehouse. \\n\\n“Chris, you’re that great humping bitch reborn. A week before she croaked \\nshe begged me to turn her loose here in the street. I turned her down because \\nI knew she had a screwy ticker. \\n\\n“So, Chris, I know you’ll prove to the stable you are just as great in the \\nstreet as you were in the house in Terre Haute. I’m taking you home to get \\npretty for the trick people, baby-bitch.” \\n\\n\\n\\n13 \\n\\nTHE ICEBERG \\n\\n\\nWhen she saw the pad she flipped. A pink silk dress from the trunk fitted \\nher perfectly. After a bath and a shampoo she was again the gorgeous Chris \\nI’d met at the Haven. \\n\\nI gave her two “go” pills and took her to the street for the cut into Phyllis \\nand Ophelia. It was midnight when I curbed in the block where they were \\nworking. They were walking together across the street. They looked over at \\nthe LaSalle. \\n\\nI blinked my headlights. They crossed the street and came toward me. The \\nrunt stuck her head through the window on Chris’s side. Ophelia was \\nstooping down, pinning Chris. \\n\\nI said, “Both of you get in.” \\n\\nThey got into the back seat. In the rear-view mirror I saw them look at each \\nother, then at the back of Chris’ head. \\n\\nI said, “Phyllis, Ophelia, meet Christine. She’s gonna work the street with \\nyou. She’s tired of giving up fifty percent of her scratch. \\n\\n“She wants Daddy to have all she makes. I pulled her outta the \\nwhorehouse. What the hell, the whole family should be together anyway. \\n\\n“Phyllis, I’ve told Christine a hundred times how great you are in the \\nstreet. She’s hip you know all the rollers and all the angles. I want you to take \\nher under your wing out here for a week or so. I know there ain’t a bitch out \\nhere that could pull her coat like you can. Now get outta the car and starve \\nthese other joker’s whores to death.” \\n\\nI watched them walk away chattering and laughing. It was like they were \\nreal sisters. I looked at my diamond-studded Longines. It was ten-after¬ \\ntwelve. How about it? I was twenty years old. I was living in a six-bill a \\nmonth pad. I had three young fine mud kickers. I was a pimp at last. \\n\\n\\n\\nI tilted down the rear-view mirror. I powdered my face. I sat there gazing \\nat myself. Finally I pulled off. I was going to Sweet’s to report my progress. I \\ndidn’t get much of a chance to rap to him. \\n\\nTwo rollers from Sweet’s precinct were drinking and horsing around with \\ntwo of Sweet’s yellow whores. Sweet told them I was his son. \\n\\nIt tickled them witless when Sweet told them what Satan and his Demon \\nhad done to me. They told me not to worry. They would remember me and \\nwould wire the other precinct rollers not to roust me. \\n\\nThe rollers finally got crocked. The whores took them around the Chinese \\nscreen into bedrooms. \\n\\nThen I said, “Sweet, I copped a beautiful yellow bitch tonight. I got her \\nhumping on the track with my girls. Sweet, the bitch is crazy about me. I \\nknow I’ll hold her for years.” \\n\\nHe said, “Slim, a pretty Nigger bitch and a white whore are just alike. They \\nboth will get in a stable to wreck it. They’ll leave the pimp on his ass with no \\nwhore. You gotta make ’em hump hard and fast. Stick ’em for long scratch \\nquick. Slim, pimping ain’t no game of love. Prat ’em and keep your swipe \\noutta ’em. Any sucker who believes a whore loves him shouldn’t a fell outta \\nhis mammy’s ass. \\n\\n“Slim, I hope you ain’t sexed that pretty bitch yet. Believe me, Slim, a \\npimp is really a whore who’s reversed the game on whores. Slim, be as sweet \\nas the scratch. Don’t be no sweeter. Always stick a whore for a bundle before \\nyou sex her. A whore ain’t nothing but a trick to a pimp. Don’t let ’em \\nGeorgia you. Always get your money in front just like a whore. \\n\\n“Whores in a stable are like working chumps in the white man’s factory. \\nThey know in their sucker tickers they’re chumping. They both gotta have \\nhorns to blow their beefs into. They gotta have someone to listen while they \\nbad mouth that Goddamn boss. \\n\\n“A good pimp is like a slick white boss. He don’t ever pair two of a kind \\nfor long. He don’t ever pair two new bitches. He ain’t stuck ’em for no long \\nscratch. A pair of new bitches got too much in common. They’ll beef to each \\nother and pool their skull, plots, and split to the wind together. \\n\\n“The real glue that holds any bitch to a pimp is the long scratch she’s hip \\nshe’s stuck for. A good pimp could cut his swipe off and still pimp his ass \\noff. Pimping ain’t no sex game. It’s a skull game. \\n\\n“A pimp with a shaky-bottom woman is like a sucker with a lit firecracker \\nstuck in his ass. When his boss bitch turns sour and blows, all the other \\n\\n\\n\\nbitches in the stable flee to the wind behind her. \\n\\n“There ain’t more than three or four good bottom women promised a pimp \\nin his lifetime. I don’t care if he cops three hundred whores before he croaks. \\n\\n“A good pimp has gotta have like a farm system for bottom women. He’s \\ngotta know what bitch in the family could be the bottom bitch when mama \\nbitch goes sour. \\n\\n“He’s gotta keep his game tighter on his bottom bitch than on any bitch in \\nthe stable. He’s gotta peep around her ass while she’s taking a crap. He’s \\ngotta know if it’s got the same stink and color it had yesterday. \\n\\n“Slim, you’re in trouble until you cop the fourth whore. A stable is sets of \\nteams playing against each other to stuff the pimp’s pockets with scratch. \\nYou got a odd bitch. You ain’t got but a team and a hall. \\n\\n“A young pimp like you is gotta learn not to cop blind. Your fourth bitch is \\ngotta be right to pair with the third whore. \\n\\n“She can’t be no ugly bitch unless she likes pussy. She can’t be smarter \\nthan the pretty bitch. She can be younger, even prettier, but she’s gotta be \\ndumber. \\n\\n“Slim, all whores have one thing in common just like the chumps humping \\nfor the white boss. It thrills ’em when the pimp makes mistakes. They watch \\nand wait for his downfall. \\n\\n“A pimp is the loneliest bastard on Earth. He’s gotta know his whores. He \\ncan’t let them know him. He’s gotta be God all the way. \\n\\n“The poor sonuvabitch has joined a hate club he can’t quit. He can’t do a \\nturn around and be a whore himself in the white boss’s stable unless he was \\nnever a pimp in the first place. \\n\\n“So, Kid, rest and dress and pimp till you croak. I ain’t had no rest in a \\ncoupla days. I think I’ll try to get some doss. Kid, these skull aches are \\ngetting bad. Good luck. Kid. Call me tomorrow, late. \\n\\n“Oh yeah, happy birthday. Kid. That rundown was a birthday present.” \\n\\nMy skull was reeling from his rundown on the way home. It was five a.m. \\nwhen I got there. The runt and Ophelia were asleep. They were locked \\ntogether like Siamese twins. \\n\\nI picked up my scratch off the dresser. It was two and a quarter bills. \\n\\nI went and looked in on Chris. She was in bed reading a book. She looked \\nup and put the book across her belly. She reached under the pillow. She gave \\nme a roll of bills. \\n\\nI checked it. There was six bits. It wasn’t bad for a new bitch who got to \\n\\n\\n\\nthe track late. She held out her arms. She was naked. I had to cop her some \\nsleep wear. To avoid her arms I lit a cigarette. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, did I do all right?” \\n\\nI said, “Chris, you made a start. It’s like the first buck of that million \\nyou’re gonna make. I oughta frame it like a sucker who’s opened a new hot- \\ndog stand. I want you to put that book down. Get some doss. I want you to \\ntake a fin to Leroy tomorrow. Hip him I’m your man now. \\n\\n“The family is gonna Cabaret tonight. It’s my birthday today. I’ll get a \\nrundown of your first night when I wake up. I’m gonna cop you a partner for \\nthe street real soon, baby. Good night, Chris.” \\n\\nWhen I woke up, it was one p.m. I turned on my side. Two big brown eyes \\nwere looking at me. It was Ophelia. She started kissing my eyelids. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, you’re so pretty. You got eyelashes just like a bitch’s. \\nPhyllis took Chris to visit that sucker in the shit-house. Daddy, can I kiss my \\ncandy?” \\n\\nI said, “Christ in Heaven, ain’t I got a whore in this family without a hot \\njib. Go on bitch. Then get your kit and trim my toenails and paint ’em. We’re \\nall going to get pretty for my birthday party tonight.” \\n\\nShe said, “How old are you. Daddy? I bet you’re nineteen.” \\n\\nI said, “Bitch, I’m a hundred-and-nineteen. I just got a pretty baby face.” \\n\\nChris and the runt got back from Leroy around three p.m. Chris had a \\nserious look on her face. \\n\\nI said, “Well how did he take the news? Did he hang himself from the bars \\nbefore your eyes?” \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, he fell apart. He would have killed me if he could have \\nreached me. He cried like his heart was broken. He said he was going to kill \\nyou wherever he saw you. I feel bad. Daddy. He really upset me. I’m going to \\nlie down. \\n\\nI thought, “That square chump is sure a whingding. I’m gonna put the hurt \\nto him fast if I run into him.” \\n\\nWe partied at a swank white joint near the Gold Coast. We got home at \\nfour a.m. I was sober. The whores were stoned. I went and got into my bed. I \\ndozed. \\n\\nAn hour later I woke up. The three whores were crowded into bed with me. \\nThey were stroking and kissing me all over. \\n\\nMr. Thriller sure ached to be a circus performer. I was having trouble \\nconvincing Mr. Thriller he had to take only one at a time. He was a pimp not \\n\\n\\n\\na freak. \\n\\nThe ring-master put the show on and stayed cool. It was eight o’clock \\nbefore I got to sleep. \\n\\nIt was a month before I copped the fourth whore. She was a cute tiny \\nseventeen-year-old broad, about Chris’ color. The stable had brought her \\nhome from a coffee joint at closing time. They took their breaks there. \\n\\nThe little broad was a waitress in the joint. She was curious about the \\nwhore game. She was wild to wear flashy clothes. She thought I was rich \\nwhen she dug the pad. The excitement in her eyes hipped me I could make a \\nfast cop. \\n\\nI took her into the living room. I cracked her into saying she’d be my \\nwoman and stop slaving for thirty a week. \\n\\nThen I gave her the pitch to tie the knot. She was sitting in a chair. I stood \\nlooking down at her. Her eyes never left my face. It was maybe like a \\nrattlesnake charming a robin. \\n\\nI said, “Jo Ann, I gotta congratulate you. You’re not only lucky, you’re \\nsmart. You knew when you saw me that I was going to be your man, I’m hip \\nthat you were just waiting to meet me. \\n\\n“You have wanted since you were a little girl to live an exciting, \\nglamorous life. Well, Sugar, you’re on Blood’s magic carpet. I’m gonna \\nmake your life with me out-shine your flashiest day dreams. \\n\\n“I’m a pimp. You gotta be a whore. I don’t have squares. I’m gonna be \\nyour mother, your father, your brother, your friend, and your lover. The most \\nimportant thing I’m gonna be to you is your man. The manager of the scratch \\nyou make in the street. Now, sweet bitch, have you followed me so far?” \\n\\nShe whispered, “Yes, Blood, I understand.” \\n\\nI reached down and took her hand. I took her to the window overlooking \\nthe city. I held her against me. \\n\\nI said, “Look out there, baby angel. Out there is where you work. Those \\nstreets are yours because you’re my woman. I’ve got five G’s in fall money. \\nIf you get busted for anything, even murder, I can free you. Baby Bitch, this \\nfamily is like a small army. We got rules and regulations we never break. \\n\\n“I am really two studs. One of them is sweet and kind to his whores when \\nthey don’t break the rules. The other one comes out insane and dangerous \\nwhen the rules are broken. Little baby. I’m sure you’ll never meet him. \\n\\n“Never forget this family is as one against the cold, cruel world. We are \\nstrong because we love each other. There’s no problem I can’t solve. There’s \\n\\n\\n\\nno question I can’t answer about this game. \\n\\n“Tomorrow I’m going to start filling your skull with everything about this \\ngame and street. I’m going to make a star outta you angel. Don’t ask any \\noutsider anything. Come to Chris or me. \\n\\n“My little baby. I’ll protect you with my last drop of blood. If any mother¬ \\nfucker in those streets out there, stud or bitch, hurts you, or threatens you, \\ncome to me. He will have to cut my throat first, shoot me first. I take an oath \\nto protect you for as long as you are my woman. Baby, I know that’s for \\nalways. Now repeat after Daddy, baby.” \\n\\nShe squeezed tightly against me. She was in a trance looking up at me. \\n\\nShe chanted along with me. “From this moment I belong to Blood. I am his \\nwhore. I will do everything he tells me. I won’t ever fuck with his scratch. I \\nwill hump my heart out every night. I’ve gotta make a bill a night.” \\n\\nShe slept with Chris that night. After the first week I knew she was the \\nperfect partner for Chris. \\n\\nSweet was right. Chris and Jo Ann ran Phyllis and Ophelia into a panting \\nlather in the street. I started wanting that fifth whore. \\n\\nLeroy got a year for the beating he gave Papa Tony. \\n\\nAbout six months later Top and I were at the Roost bar. A loudmouth joker \\nbeside me was arguing with a stud on his other side. I had my back to him, \\nfacing Top. \\n\\nTop and I had been shooting stuff for several hours in his pad. I was so \\nfrosted with cocaine I felt embalmed. It was maybe like I was at the Roost \\nand I really wasn’t. I had raised my glass of Coke to my jib. I was being \\nfascinated by the tiny bubbles popping inside the glass. \\n\\nI was trying to count them before they all popped away. \\n\\nI heard an explosion behind me. My skull was numb. It was maybe like the \\nnoise behind me happened a year ago on an ice floe in the Arctic somewhere. \\n\\nI saw a light gray lid that stirred a faint memory. It wobbled across the log \\nand stopped in front of where Top had been. \\n\\nI thought, “That’s a Knox forty. I had one once that color.” \\n\\nThat crazy joker Top was on the floor between the log and his stool. His \\neyes were wide in fear. He was looking up at me like he thought I had gone \\nbats and was going to croak him. I laughed at him. \\n\\nI heard running feet behind me. I looked over my shoulder. The joker who \\nhad been arguing with Loud Mouth was running through the door with a rod \\nin his hand. \\n\\n\\n\\nI looked behind me. Loud Mouth was on his back, out cold. He had a long, \\nred gouge across his temple. Some of the frost melted away in my skull. \\n\\nThe bullet that grazed Loud Mouth had torn my lid off. The joint was still. \\nTop was standing and dusting himself off. The joint had emptied. I reached \\nover and picked my lid off the bar. \\n\\nI took a casual look at the entrance, exit holes in the top of the crown. I \\nstuck it on my head. Top was staring at me. I tilted my glass and drained it. I \\nturned to Top. Loud Mouth was groaning and coming to on the floor. \\n\\nI said, “Jack, let’s get outta here before the rollers come. I ain’t got time for \\na quiz. You know Top, if my skull had been pointed, I’da had a bad break.” \\n\\nTop followed me out the door. We got into his Hog in front of the Roost. \\nTop was still staring at me. His jib was gaping. \\n\\nHe said, “Kid, I saw it but I don’t believe it. I’ve seen some cool studs in \\nmy time, but I ain’t never seen nothing to equal that. \\n\\n“Kid, you were cold in there, icy; icy, like an iceberg. Kid, I got it. You’re \\ngetting to be a good young pimp. All good pimps got monikers. I’m gonna \\nhang one on you. \\n\\n“Kid you’ve outgrown ‘Young Blood’ as a moniker. How about ‘Iceberg \\nSlim’? Kid, it’s a beautiful fit. ‘Iceberg Slim,’ how about it, and I thought it \\nup. Cocaine sure chills you. I guess you picked the right high for you.” \\n\\n\\n\\n14 \\n\\nTHE MISTAKE \\n\\n\\nBy the end of the year I had copped a new thirty-nine Hog. I had blown Jo \\nAnn ninety days after I got her. She was too possessive and she didn’t really \\nhave the guts for a long stretch in the street. \\n\\nI didn’t cry when she left. While I had her, Chris kept her humping. I was \\nthousands ahead of her when she slipped away from Chris in the street. \\n\\nA week later I copped a young whore that was a whiz in the street and was \\nhip to boosting. She went ape over Chris. She’d go downtown and come \\nhome with shopping bags loaded with fine dresses and underclothes for \\nherself and her sisters. \\n\\nLater she hipped Chris to boosting. I let them go down together with a stud \\nwho drove for them. They filled my closet with beautiful vines. \\n\\nTop got five years on a narcotics rap. The federal heat tricked him into a \\nfour-piece sale to an undercover agent. I sure missed him. I hung out at \\nSweet’s more than ever. \\n\\nMy name was ringing. The moniker Top hung on me stuck. Everybody \\nwas calling me Iceberg, even Sweet. Only I and the several peddlers I copped \\nfrom knew that my icy front was really backed by the freezing cocaine I \\nsnorted and banged every day. \\n\\nI pimped strictly by the book for the next three years. I traded in a Hog \\neach year. I never had less than five girls in the family. \\n\\nI moved out of Top’s building and let the family stay there. I took a suite in \\na swank midtown hotel. I had the privacy, the jewelry, and all the flash and \\nglamour of a successful pimp. \\n\\nI had managed to solve the fast track. I was fast becoming one of its \\nlegends. \\n\\nTop had gotten out. He was in Seattle with relatives serving out his short \\n\\n\\n\\nparole paper. Only one of his women stuck with him. The rest got in the wind \\nwhen he fell. \\n\\nThe runt was still bottom woman. Ophelia was still hung up on her. Chris \\nwas proving every day she had the qualities for a bottom woman. \\n\\nI noticed the runt was acting like she might be wearing thin fast. The other \\ntwo whores I had had been stable mates. I copped them when their pimp shot \\nan overdose of H. \\n\\nI was at Sweet’s when Pearl Harbor was bombed. I had stayed all night. I \\nwas still in bed. \\n\\nThe friendly brown snake had brought my breakfast. I was just finishing \\nwhen Sweet walked into the bedroom. He sat down on the side of the bed. \\n\\nHe said, “’Berg, Uncle Sam just got his throat cut. The Slant Eyes just put \\nthe torch to Pearl Harbor. Whores gonna make more scratch now than ever \\nbefore. ’Berg I got a feeling this Second World War is gonna hurt the pimp \\ngame in the long run.” \\n\\nI said, “Sweet, how do you figure that?” \\n\\nHe said, “You know a whore ain’t nothing but a ex-square. A good pimp \\nwears out a lot of whores in his lifetime. If there ain’t no big pool of squares \\nfor the pimps to turn out, then stables gotta get smaller. \\n\\n“The defense plants are gonna claim thousands of young potential whores. \\nThose square bitches are gonna get those pay checks. They’ll get shitty \\nindependent. A pimp can’t turn them out. \\n\\n“The older square broads are going into the plants too. Thousands of them \\ngot teenage daughters. They’ll have the scratch to fill the bellies of those \\nyoung bitches. They’ll put nice clothes on their backs. Why the hell should \\nthey whore for a pimp. They can pimp on Mama. \\n\\n“The worse thing is, those plants are inviting whores with strict pimps to \\nsplit and square up. If the war lasts a long time, pimps will have to turn pussy \\nto hold a whore. \\n\\n“’Berg, ain’t but one real Heaven for a pimp. He’s in it when there’s a big \\npool of raggedy, hungry young bitches.” \\n\\nThe war was raging. The defense plants were grinding out war goods \\naround the clock. Thousands of young and old broads were slaving in them. \\n\\nAs far as I was concerned, the pool was still full of fine fish. I had three \\noriginal girls and three new cops. \\n\\nIt was December, nineteen-forty-four. Sweet was still pimping good for an \\nold man. He was down to seven women, but this was great pimping for a stud \\n\\n\\n\\nhis age. Top had settled out West. \\n\\nI had held Chris, Ophelia, and the runt a long time. Since thirty-eight I had \\ncopped and blown sixty to seventy whores and turnouts. \\n\\nThe turn-over in turnouts was big. Some of them would hump for a month \\nand split. Some a week. Others a couple hours before they cut out. Sweet had \\nbeen so right years ago. The pimp game was sure “cop and blow.” \\n\\nI spent Christmas day with Mama. She was really happy to see me. She \\nhadn’t seen me since thirty-eight. She cried as always when I left her. \\n\\nThe runt was getting tired and evil. Several of those turnouts she had run \\naway from me. All new turn-outs I was giving to Chris to polish in the street. \\n\\nI started sending the runt to small towns near army camps. Some of them \\nwere out of state. Sometimes Ophelia went with her. A week before I met \\nCarmen, the runt and Ophelia had come back from a weekend in Wisconsin. \\n\\nThe runt and the other five girls were with me when I copped the seventh \\ngirl. \\n\\nShe was almost a perfect copy of the runt at eighteen. She had a prettier \\nface than the runt had at eighteen. Her features were more regular. Time and \\nstreet had bulldogged the once cute Peke face of the runt. \\n\\nWe were at a cabaret. Carmen was behind a twenty-six game table in the \\nbarroom. I left my table and went to the John. I passed Carmen on the way. \\nShe gave me a strong lick. \\n\\nOn the way back I stopped and tossed a quarter on her table and rolled the \\ndice trying for a score of twenty-six. I hit twenty-six, so I bought us a drink \\nwith the score. I stood beside the table and quizzed her. She was from Peoria. \\nShe’d been in town a week. \\n\\nWe had old Party Time in common. She had met him up in Peoria where \\nhe was still living. He had a whore in a house up there. She had worked in the \\nsame house. She had run off from her pimp and she was wide open for a fast \\ncop. \\n\\nWe rapped for fifteen or twenty minutes. I could tell she went for me. She \\nlooked at the clock. It was almost closing time. I invited her to have breakfast \\nat the family’s pad. \\n\\nWe’d had breakfast. I was leaving with Carmen. I was going to my place \\nto put her under contract. The runt followed me outside to the hallway. She \\ncalled me. \\n\\nI gave Carmen the key to the Hog. She went toward the elevator. I didn’t \\nmove toward the runt. I said, “Bitch, you wanna rap to me, come to me.” She \\n\\n\\n\\nhad a tight evil look on her face. She walked slowly np to me. Top was right. \\nThese bottom broads, when they started to rot, really funked up a stud’s skull. \\n\\nShe said, “You ain’t thinking about bringing that bullshit bitch into this \\nfamily are you? That phony bitch ain’t shit.” \\n\\nI said, “What the hell. You mean you’re gonna turn down a chance to \\nLarceny a new bitch away. You stinking bitch, nobody tells me what bitch to \\nhave. You got the nerve to crack some bitch is phony. I had to almost croak \\nyou to make you real.” \\n\\nI noticed two of the latest cops were in the open door. They were \\neyeballing down the hall at our show. \\n\\nShe shouted, “Nigger, you were a raggity nowhere scarecrow until you got \\nme. You didn’t have no wheels. You muscled me for mine. Nigger, I’m the \\nbitch that made you great. Without me, right now you’d go to the bottom fast \\nas shit through a greasy funnel.” \\n\\nI made a bad mistake. I shoulda maybe used Top’s jellied skull technique \\nto get rid of her. Instead I left-hooked her hard as I could against the jaw. \\nThere was a pop like a firecracker going off. She fell to the carpet in a quiet \\nheap. I kicked her big rear end a dozen times. I walked to the elevator. I \\nlooked down the hall. I saw Ophelia and Chris dragging her toward the \\napartment. \\n\\nThe runt got her broken jaw wired up. She split with Ophelia. Chris said \\nshe tried to take two of the newer girls with her too. I had made a pimp’s \\nclassic blunder. I had blown a tired bottom bitch in the rough. \\n\\nCarmen was an easy cop. A pimp wants everybody who can hump his \\npockets fat. He’s in real clover when he cops a fine young whore who wants \\nhim. Carmen really wanted me. She was starting with Chris. \\n\\nSix months later Sweet called me early in the morning. His voice was \\nlaced with excitement. I jerked erect in bed. \\n\\nHe said, “’Berg, I got a wire the F.B.I is nosing around some of the broad \\nlock-ups. They’re quizzing whores. Your name has been cracked more than \\nonce. It looks like they already got a solid beef to go on. It’s my guess they’re \\ntrying to build a five or six count rap against you.” \\n\\nI said, “Sweet, I bet it’s that stinking runt. Christ! Sweet, I’ve sent her and \\nOphelia across state lines a dozen times since the war started. They’re trying \\nto ram a white-slave rap into me. Sweet. What would you do?” \\n\\nHe said, “I would give one of those nice sweet jokers on the West Side \\nexpense scratch and a ball-peen hammer. I’d tell him as soon as I read they \\n\\n\\n\\nwas found in an alley with their skulls caved in he could get a cinch two \\ngrand. \\n\\n“It would be easy to trap ’em. They’re whores. He’d be just another \\nfreakish trick wanting to party with two whores. \\n\\n“Tell you what, ’Berg get them whores outta that crib over there fast. \\nMove outta your pad today. Go groundhog. Switch your whores to new \\nstomping grounds. Stay outta the street after you move. Call me when you get \\noutta there.” \\n\\nHe hung up. I thought, “I’m a sucker. I shoulda destroyed the runt Top’s \\nway.” \\n\\nI had moved the stable and myself to new pads by seven that night. Chris, \\nmy new bottom woman, was the only one in the family who knew the reason \\nfor the move. \\n\\nI took the Hog and put it in a garage I rented from an old widower. The \\ngarage was behind his house in a respectable neighborhood. \\n\\nI got a cab to one of my stuff connections. I was going underground. I had \\nto have at least a piece of stuff. I had copped and was walking down the street \\nlooking for a cab. \\n\\nI passed a barber shop. I got a glimpse of the white-spatted dogs of a joker \\nin the barber’s chair, next to the window. \\n\\nI thought, “Geez, that square joker is pitiful. He ain’t hip spats went out \\nwith high-button shoes.” \\n\\nI was walking fast. I had the sizzle on me. I needed a cab in the worse way. \\nI was almost a half block from the barber shop. I thought I heard some joker \\nyelling, “Run! Run!” \\n\\nI looked back over my shoulder. A tall skinny stud in a barber’s apron was \\non the sidewalk. His white spats flashed on his feet. He was screaming and \\nflailing his arms like a minstrel clown singing “Mammy.” \\n\\nHe was loping down the sidewalk. The out-of-fashion bastard was \\nyelping,” Son! Son!” He galloped by the neon lights toward me. His wrinkled \\nbrown-skin face changed colors like a chameleon. \\n\\nHe ran into me and clutched me like I was a winning sweepstakes ticket. \\nHe was panting and sweating like a whore on soldier’s payday. I could smell \\nwitch hazel and the stink of emotion sweat. I saw white specks of barber’s \\ntalc on the bald crown of his head. I couldn’t see his face. He had it buried in \\nmy chest. \\n\\nHe was blubbering, “Oh son, precious son. Sweet Jesus answered an old \\n\\n\\n\\nman’s prayer. He’s let me see and hold my one and only son before I got to \\nmy heavenly rest.” \\n\\nI had the damnedest thought while he made love to me. I wondered if my \\nskull had chipped any paint off that wall he threw me against when I was six- \\nmonths old. \\n\\nI stiff-armed him away. I stared coldly into his face. I saw a weak blaze of \\nanger light his dull brown eyes. \\n\\nHe said, “God don’t like ugly, son. You saw your father back there. You \\nignored me, didn’t you?” \\n\\nI said, “Shit no I didn’t see you. I thought you had croaked. Look Jack, I’m \\nhappy to see you, but I’m in an awful hurry. See you around.” \\n\\nHe said, “I did my part to bring you into this world. You ain’t gonna treat \\nme like a dog. Where do you live? You look prosperous. What’s your line? \\nAre you with some big company? Are you married to some nice girl? Do I \\nhave any grandchildren, son?” \\n\\nI said, “You haven’t heard about Iceberg Slim? He’s famous.” \\n\\nHe said, “You don’t associate with black filth like that I hope.” \\n\\nI said, “Look Jack, I am Iceberg. Ain’t you proud of me? I’m the greatest \\nNigger that ever came outta our family. I got five whores humping sparks \\noutta their asses.” \\n\\nI thought he was going to have a heart attack. The apron was quivering \\nover his ticker. He was supporting himself against a lamp post. His face was \\ngray in shock under the streetlight. I jerked my shirt and coat sleeves up past \\nspike hollow. I stuck the needle-scarred arm under his nose. He drew back \\nfrom it. \\n\\nI said, “Goddamnit Jack, what’s the matter? Shit, I shoot more scratch into \\nthat arm a day than you make in a week. I’ve come a long way since you \\nbounced my skull off that wall. Stick your chest out in pride. Jack. I been in \\ntwo prisons already. Shit, Jack, I’m on my way to the third any day now. You \\nain’t hip I’m important? Maybe one of these days I’ll really make you a \\nproud father. I’ll croak a whore and make the Chair.” \\n\\nI walked away from him. I caught a cab at the corner. The cabbie u-turned. \\nI looked at my old man. He was sitting on the curb beside the lamp post. His \\nwhite spats gleamed starkly in the gutter. He had his head on his knees. I saw \\nhis back jerking up and down. The poor joker was bawling his ass off. \\n\\nI got home. I called Sweet. I banged a load of cocaine. It was the best I’d \\ncopped since Glass Top went to the joint. \\n\\n\\n\\n15 \\n\\nIN A SEWER \\n\\n\\nAfter I had called Sweet and banged the cocaine, I had chilling thoughts. \\n\\n“I’ve got five whores just like poor Preston had when Sweet crossed and \\ndestroyed him. I wonder if Sweet will dream up a cross to steal my whores \\nfrom me? He knows where I’m padding. It would be as easy as lifting a \\ntelephone receiver. Sweet swears he loves me like I’m his son. \\n\\n“These seven years on this fast track have hipped me to one solid truth. To \\na pimp there’s nothing more important than copping whores. While I’m holed \\nup, I’ll keep my stable headaches a secret, I won’t give him a cue to volunteer \\nhis help. It would be a bitch to have him handling my stable. I’m sure glad \\nChris is a boss bottom bitch. \\n\\n“Oh! This pressure is really screwing my skull around. Sweet wouldn’t \\ncross me. I gotta stop mistrusting the only friend I got. I mean more to Sweet \\nas his friend than any whore. \\n\\n“Maybe I should make a run for it and set up shop in some other city. \\nChrist! Why do I have to be red hot with federal heat? Why couldn’t it be city \\nor state heat? On this fast track I’ve only been busted and mugged once. A \\ndozen other times I paid off on the street. \\n\\n“That F.B.I. is a sonuvabitching genius. No, I’d better keep my hot ass in \\ntown right here in this cruddy pig sty. \\n\\n“The runt’s a whore. Maybe her new pimp or a trick will croak her. Then I \\ncould walk into the F.B.I. office and stick my black ass out to be kissed. \\nThey’d have no case without the runt as a witness.” \\n\\n“The runt took Ophelia on all those out-of-state trips. I gave the runt \\ninstructions and expense money. I ain’t never told Ophelia to cross a state \\nline. The runt was screwing Ophelia. That was really the runt’s bitch.” \\n\\n“It’s a good thing I holed up in this rat’s nest. The F.B.I. would never look \\n\\n\\n\\nfor a good pimp in a sewer.” \\n\\nIt was December, nineteen-forty-five. The war was over. The world was \\nlicking its bloody wounds. Drugs and the pimp game had hardened away my \\nbaby face. My hair was thinning. I was turning twenty-eight but I looked \\nforty. \\n\\nFor seven years I had devoted myself to getting hip to that pimp’s book. I \\nhad labored with the zeal of a Catholic Brother agonizing for the Priesthood. \\nI had thought and acted like a black God. \\n\\nI was now trapped in my dingy one-room kitchenette. It was in a very old \\ntwo-story building. I was on the first floor in the rear in number ten. Down \\nthe hall at night, rats would come scampering and squealing from the alley. \\nThey came under the back door which hung crookedly on its hinges. \\n\\nI had a vague disturbing doubt in my skull. Was it possible I wasn’t even a \\npoor imitation of a God? Maybe I was just a sucker black pimp on his way to \\na third bit in the joint. \\n\\nChris was the only one of the stable that visited me. We’d bang cocaine \\ntogether. I wouldn’t let her know how worried I was. God couldn’t have skull \\naches. \\n\\nI couldn’t let the others see me in a crummy setting. After all, how could a \\nGod live like a square chump? Chris knew all the reasons why. To her God’s \\nfarts still had the fragrant odor of roses. I worked out with Chris a smooth \\nsystem. Even the best pimp has to keep some personal contact with his \\nwhores. \\n\\nThe system was simple and for a while effective. Chris and I would go out \\ninto the hall to the phone on the wall. She could call the stable at their pad. It \\nwould always be three or four o’clock in the morning. \\n\\nOne of the girls would pick up. Chris would pretend to be a long-distance \\noperator. It was rare luck that Chris had a talent for mimicry. They didn’t get \\nhip to it. It would always be a person-toperson call from me to one of them. \\nChris and I conned them the calls came from New York, Boston, and \\nPhiladelphia. \\n\\nI would get on the line and talk to all four of them. There were extensions \\nin all four bedrooms. I could con and tighten my game on all of them at the \\nsame time. \\n\\nThe first call we made was supposed to be from New York. It took maybe \\na minute for me to have all their horns to receivers. \\n\\nI said, “Well girls, I know you’ve missed Daddy. You’ve all probably \\n\\n\\n\\nwondered, when in the hell is Daddy coming back to town? Jesus Christ! Has \\nhe forgotten a whore needs to see her man some time? Sure we’re in his \\ncorner. We prove that when we hump our asses off in the street. We check \\nour scratch into Chris to send to him. \\n\\n“Goddamnit, what could be so important that he neglects his whores? Well \\ngirls. I’m gonna show the kinda confidence Daddy’s got in you. I’m gonna \\nhip you to a million-dollar secret. I know all of you will keep your jibs \\nbuttoned.” \\n\\nChris cut in crisply and said, “Three minutes are up, Sir. Please signal \\nwhen through.” \\n\\nI continued, “You are the luckiest whores alive. Your man’s got a genius \\nwhite engraver for his pal. He used to be an engraver for the government. \\nWe’ve got some plates he’s just finished. We’ve turned out three-hundred of \\nthe prettiest hundred-slat bills the human eye has ever seen. They’re perfect. \\nEven the government couldn’t get hip to a difference from real scratch. There \\nain’t any. \\n\\n“We got one problem we’re gonna solve if it takes a year. We’ve run outta \\nthe special paper the government prints its scratch on. My white genius pal \\neven knows how to make the paper. We are playing it cool and traveling and \\ncopping inks and other stuff we need. It’s tough to cop some of it, but for \\nmillions who’s going to give up? As soon as we get the paper made up we’re \\ngonna run off a couplamillion or so slats. \\n\\n“I’m gonna breeze back into town the only millionaire pimp in the world. \\nI’m gonna buy a beach and a mansion in Hawaii for my stable. If we run \\noutta scratch, we’ll just run off another bale. \\n\\n“So stay cool and keep humping. Oh yeah, Chris got a cab to the airport an \\nhour ago. She should be getting home in a coupla hours or so. She’s bringing \\neach of you a piece of that beautiful lettuce. Spend it on anything you want. \\nTake it anywhere, even a bank. Believe me, it’s perfect.” \\n\\nI hung up. I had electrified them with the story. I could hear the excited \\nthrill in their voices when they chorused goodbye. I told Chris to crack the \\ngenius had a way to make all the serial numbers on the bills different. I \\nalready knew what my story would be whenever I got the heat off me. \\n\\nI could stall them a lifetime. I could say the genius got busted on another \\nbeef. I had to wait until he got out. He wouldn’t tell me where the plates were \\nhidden. He could even croak while doing his bit. \\n\\nChris called the next day. The whores were walking on air. They rapped all \\n\\n\\n\\nnight about that perfect “queer.” I was sure I had found the way to hold my \\nstable. I felt like a genius myself. \\n\\nEach time I talked to the stable after that, the genius and I had just copped \\nanother vital item we needed. It wouldn’t be long now I assured them. Sweet \\nhad dropped the word in the street that I was on the West Coast taking off \\nlong scratch from a rich square broad. \\n\\nIt was getting almost impossible to sleep. I would almost jump from my \\nskin when a tenant would knock. I would think it was the heat. The tenant \\nwould be calling me to the phone in the hall. When I did fall off into fitful \\nsleep I’d have nightmares. Those dreams about Mama would hog-tie me on a \\nsweaty rack of misery. I had an awful fear of another jolt in the joint. The \\nguilty daydreams on the heels of the nightmares were torturing my skull. \\n\\nI stopped banging cocaine. It only magnified my terror and worry. I \\nremembered how serene Top used to look after a bang of H. He’d sit and \\ncoast like he was in a beautiful peaceful dream. Maybe he’d been right. \\nMaybe sable H came after mink cocaine. \\n\\nChris came on Christmas Eve. She stayed until Christmas Day afternoon. \\nShe brought me pajamas, cologne and robes from herself and the girls. She \\nhad given them scratch from me. \\n\\nMy one-room kitchenette hideout was crammed wall to wall with trunks \\nand suitcases. I had all those fine threads and no place to go. I was a lonely \\npimp bastard! \\n\\nSweet came to see me at midnight in January, the tenth I think. He took off \\nhis velvet-collared Melton benny. He hung it in the tiny closet. It had been \\nten-below-zero or colder for a week. \\n\\nIt was a brand new year, nineteen-forty-six. The new Hogs were out for the \\nfirst time in several years. The garage rent was paid for a year for my old \\nHog. Chris had gone out several times to run its engine for awhile. \\n\\nI thought “Christ it would be a kick to trade off and flash through the fresh \\nair in a new Hog.” \\n\\nIt was the first time Sweet had visited me. He was getting white around his \\ntemples. There was less fiery voltage in his gray eyes. That H and the fast \\ntrack had him looking terrible. He was getting old all right. He sat down on a \\nsuitcase at the head of the bed. I was lying down. Miss Peaches was an old \\nlady, but still gorgeous in her mink coat and fur bootees. He slipped off her \\ncoat and shoes. He put them on the dresser. She sat on the floor looking up at \\n\\n\\nme. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe said, “’Berg got bad news for you. The street wire says city rollers are \\ncarrying a mug shot of you around. You’re really hot now. I gotta wire that \\npimping Poison is nosing around your girls in the street. If you ain’t got Chris \\ntight, he’ll steal her. She’s gonna hip him where you’re hiding. \\n\\n“Maybe you oughta get outta this joint tonight. Take another hide out. \\nDon’t let Chris or any whore you got know where you are. I’m your bosom \\nbuddy, sweetheart, and I love you. I’ll keep the stable in line for you. \\n\\n“In the meantime I could figure an angle to get your balls outta the hot \\nsand. All you gotta do is call your girls. Tell ’em you want Uncle Sweet to \\nlook out for ’em for a coupla weeks. It’s easy. Pal.” \\n\\nI just lay there for a long moment feeling myself tremble. If he had been \\nlovable Henry, my stepfather, saying he hated me, I couldn’t have felt worse. \\nTrue, I had conquered the fast track, but that sucker inside me I couldn’t kill \\nwas hurting the hell out of me. I looked at him. Somehow I kept my voice \\nsteady and the pain outta my eyes. \\n\\nI said, “Jeez Sweet, I’d have a bitch of a time trying to cop another friend \\nlike you. I feel like bawling just to think about it. I ran down my life story to \\nyou. You know I love you like I loved Henry. Maybe I love you. Sweet, more \\nthan I love Mama. \\n\\n“Don’t think I’m a chump square when I say it. Sweet, you taught me to be \\ncold-hearted. You’re the only person on Earth who could hurt me. The jokers \\nin the street call me Iceberg. \\n\\n“They’d laugh their asses off if they knew I was weak for a stud I love like \\na father. Sweet please don’t hip them I got a sucker weakness. Don’t ever do \\nanything to croak my love for you. Sweet, if you ever do, they’ll all get hip. \\n\\n“I’ll maybe fall apart and run through the streets wailing like a crazy bitch. \\nSweet, I’ll wait and think for a day or so. Poison can’t steal Chris. I’ll kick \\nthings around in my skull. Maybe you should be looking out for the stable. \\n\\nThe whole time I was talking, he had run his index fingers along the sword \\nedges of his pant’s creases. His gray eyes had found the suitcases and \\ncluttered room fascinating works of art. He swallowed air and tented his \\nbejeweled fingers under his first chin. \\n\\nHe said, “’Berg, this joint is wrecking your skull. Sweet would chop his \\nright arm off before he’d cross you. You’re the only friend I got, sweetheart. \\nShit, Honey, you could have a hundred whores and I could be whoreless. I’d \\nask you to give me a bitch. I wouldn’t try to steal no whore from you. \\nDarling. You need anything? I gotta split. I got two whores I gotta pick up \\n\\n\\n\\ndowntown.” \\n\\nI said, “No Sweet, I don’t need anything. I’ll rap to you tomorrow. If you \\nhear anything, wire me fast. I’m sure glad you dropped by.” \\n\\nI heard his heavy feet pounding down the linoleum in the hall. They \\nstopped. I heard them getting louder. He was coming back. I looked around \\nthe suitcase where he had been sitting. I didn’t see anything he had left. He \\nthumped the door. I opened it. He had Miss Peaches in his arms. He was \\nflashing the first gold-toothed grin I’d ever seen on his face. \\n\\nHe said, “’Berg I forgot to tell you. They found old Pretty Preston frozen \\nstiff in the alley back of the Roost. The poor bastard had wrapped himself in \\nnewspapers. The Greek fired him a week ago for staying near the fire and not \\npulling marks on the sidewalk. The drunk half-white bastard thought the \\nnewspapers could stand off ten-below-zero.” \\n\\nHe turned and walked down the hall. I shut the door and fell across the \\nbed. At three Chris called. I told her to stay away until my next phony long¬ \\ndistance call to the girls. I told her Poison might try to tail her, and maybe the \\nF.B.I. \\n\\nShe told me they didn’t have a chance. She went in front doors of a half- \\ndozen buildings then out the back doors before she came to me. When she got \\nto my place she’d come in the back door and walk through the front door. \\nShe’d go through the alley then through the back door again before she came \\nto my door. \\n\\nMaybe they couldn’t keep a tail on her. I told her to stay away to play safe. \\nI told her not to call from the pad. It would be a bitch if one of the girls \\npicked up an extension. \\n\\nSweet called the next morning at one a.m. The broad next door answered \\nthe phone. She knocked on my door. I slipped on an overcoat and walked into \\nthe hall. It felt like zero out there. \\n\\nHe said, “’Berg, I just got the wire. Poison stole your young bitch. Fay. I \\nhope she ain’t hip to anything that can cross you. ‘Berg,’ you gotta make \\nsome moves. I’ll keep my horns to the wire.” \\n\\nHe hung up. I was in trouble. I went and got back in bed. \\n\\nI thought, “Poison’s gonna quiz that stinking bitch. She’s gonna spill that \\n‘queer scratch’ con I’ve been playing. To tighten his game on her he’s gonna \\nwake her to the con. He’s gonna tell her I’m hiding out in the city. \\n\\n“It’s a good thing Chris is in on the con. I could blow whoreless in an hour \\nif she wasn’t. I need her to take the rest of the stable underground. Maybe I \\n\\n\\n\\nshoulda split outta town when I first got hot. I gotta move the rest of the \\nstable fast. \\n\\n“Poison is a cinch to pull their coats to the con I played. It’s the ace to play \\nfor a fast cop of maybe the other three. They’ll be salty as hell with me if he \\ngets a chance to wake ’em up. Hurry Chris and call!” \\n\\nAt three Chris called. I ran to the phone in my pajamas. I almost froze to \\ndeath talking to her. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I had to call you from home. Poison just left with Fay \\nand her clothes. The black bastard has wised up the whole family to that \\ngame we played. Dot, Rose, and Penny are larcenied to the gills. They’re \\ncrying and packing their clothes. I can’t hold them. They hate me. Poison \\ncame into my bedroom before he split. He acted and rapped like I was \\nalready his whore. If I’d had a pistol I’d have croaked the strong bastard. \\n\\n“He said, ‘Well Miss Bitch, your Nigger is finished. You’re the only whore \\nhe’s got left. I know a fast pretty bitch like you don’t want no pimp you gotta \\nsolo for. With my Fay cop, I got eight whores. I’m on the inside of this game. \\nNone of my whores take falls. I’m top pimp in town. \\n\\n“‘You’re the best whore in town. There ain’t nobody but me you can take \\nfor your man. Bitch, come to me and you can be queen boss bitch of the \\neight-whore stable. Get your domes and get outta here with me and Fay. \\nIceberg is going to the federal joint.’” \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, what happens now? Maybe Poison will come back and \\ngorilla me. I’m so upset, I know any minute I’ll scream myself into a padded \\ncell.” \\n\\nThe zero drafts blasting through the gap under the back door kept me from \\npassing out. I felt cold sweat dripping down my shaking legs. My throat was \\nhaving dry convulsions. My voice sounded like it came from an echo \\nchamber. \\n\\nI stammered, “Chris, don’t lose your cool. This is Iceberg remember? Like \\nalways I’ll put an angle together. Now listen carefully. Pack your things. Go \\ndown and get the building flunky. Pay him to take you to a hotel near the \\ngarage where the Hog is stashed. \\n\\n“Check in and leave your things. Go to the Hog. Drive back and pick up \\nyour stuff. Go downtown and check into a hotel. Drive the Hog back and \\nstash it back in the garage. Take an El train back to your hotel. Call me then.” \\n\\nI went back and washed my face in cold water. I looked in the mirror. I \\nlooked like I had on a Halloween fright mask. I sure didn’t look a bit like a \\n\\n\\n\\nfresh-faced kid any more. The whites of my oncebright eyes were blood-shot \\nand faded. The deep black circles looked like some tricky practical joker had \\nconned me to ram inked spyglasses against the sockets. \\n\\nI started looking for a yellow. I had to put a damper on my nerves. I had a \\nlittle cocaine. I didn’t need racing. I needed some skull pacifying. I was out \\nof yellows. \\n\\nSomewhere in one of the suitcases I had a notebook. The phone number of \\na connection no farther than fifteen blocks away was in it. Maybe he had \\nyellows. If not, what the hell, I’d cop a cap of H. One cap couldn’t hook me. \\nHorse was a cinch to kick the jitters outta my skull. \\n\\nIt would be two hours at least before Chris would call back. I found his \\nnumber. I called him. I told him, in code. I’d pick up six caps within the hour. \\n\\nI had a fat roll of scratch in a sock pinned inside the sleeve of a trench coat. \\nI started to take it with me. I stuck it in my benny pocket. It bulged like a \\ngrapefruit. I’d be back before long. I pinned it back inside the sleeve. \\n\\nI had close to sixty-eight hundred slats stashed there. I fished out three saw \\nbucks. I slipped pants and a shirt over my pajamas. I put on shoes and a \\nheavy benny. \\n\\nI was in a helluva hurry. I pulled the door shut. I heard the spring-latch \\nlock. Less than five minutes after I had talked to the peddler, I was on the \\nway. It was four a.m. when I left. The wintry winds almost snatched my lid \\noff my skull. It felt good though. It was the first time I’d walked in the fresh \\nair for months. \\n\\nA bleak overcast blotting out the sky. Slipping and sliding on the icy \\nsidewalks, I finally got to the connection. He lived on the second floor over \\nan all-night chili joint. The joint was crowded. There was no one on the \\nsidewalk. I went up the rickety stairs and copped five caps of H. He put the \\ncaps into the cellophane shell from a cigarette pack. He twisted the end and \\nballed the package. \\n\\nI took it and went down the stairs to the street. I had the sizzle in my hand. \\nI started to walk by the chili spot on my way home. Two neatly dressed \\nbrown skin studs were standing on the sidewalk in front of the joint. Its bright \\nlights floodlighted the sidewalk. It was like walking a show-up stage at a \\npolice station. \\n\\nFrom the side vent in my eye I saw them pinning me. They stiffened. One \\nof them reached toward his chest. I looked back. He was showing his buddy a \\nsmall square of paper. I started walking fast away from them. \\n\\n\\n\\nI remembered the sizzle. I downed it and walked faster. I knew they \\ncouldn’t see in the darkness that I had dropped it. I glanced over my shoulder. \\nI saw a rod in the hand of the taller one as they ran toward me. I ran. \\n\\nThey were bellowing, “Halt! Police! Halt! Stop or we’ll shoot!” \\n\\nI had reached the corner and was halfway around it. I saw a fourman squad \\nof white detectives. They were cruising toward me in a police car. They \\nthrew a blinding spotlight on me. I froze. They all looked at me. I saw a \\nshotgun muzzle ease out of a fast-lowering rear side window. \\n\\nThe two rollers chasing me skidded around the corner. In a way I was glad \\nto see them. Those rollers in the cruiser probably hadn’t croaked anybody in \\na week. I really didn’t want them to break their luck on me. \\n\\nThe two held onto me like I was Sutton. The white rollers shut off the \\nspotlight and moved slowly down the street past us. The shorter one had \\nhandcuffed my hands behind me. He showed his buddy the picture. They \\nlooked up at me. \\n\\nThe taller one said, “Yeah, it’s the bastard all right. Look at the eyes.” \\n\\nThey searched me head to toe. They saw the lone saw buck I had. They \\nhustled me back around the corner. We passed a skinny black joker standing \\non the corner. He nodded at me. I recognized him. He was in my building. I \\nhad sent him for groceries and change for the phone a dozen times. \\n\\nI got a fast glimpse of the picture as the roller slipped it back inside his \\ncoat pocket. It was me. I remembered the pearl-gray sharkskin suit and black \\nshirt. Top and I had been together four years ago. The two white rollers who \\nhad hit on us hated Top because he had white whores. They wouldn’t take a \\npay off. They booked us on suspicion of homicide and mugged us. Top and I \\nwere out in less than two hours. It was the one and only time I had been taken \\nin on the fast track. \\n\\nThey put me into the rear seat of an unmarked Chevy. They were in the \\nfront seat as the tall one drove away. \\n\\nI said, “Gentlemen, it’s not gonna put any scratch in your mitts to take me \\nin. Let me give you the price of a couple fine vines to cut me loose.” \\n\\nSlim said, “Shit, you couldn’t cop one bullshit vine in a hock shop with the \\nscratch you’re carrying.” \\n\\nI said, “I got more scratch at my pad. Knowing I’m Iceberg you can \\nbelieve that, can’t you? Just run me by there. I’ll get it, lay a coupla C’s \\napiece on you and fade away. How about it?” \\n\\nSlim and Shorty looked at each other. \\n\\n\\n\\nShorty said, “You think we’re suckers? You got a federal warrant for white \\nslavery outstanding. We didn’t hear a word you said about that chicken shit \\nfour C’s.” \\n\\nI said, “All right, so we’re all like black brothers. The bad difference is the \\nF.B.I. wants to lynch your brother in court. You gonna throw me to the white \\nfolks for hanging? I’ll give you two grand apiece to beat the F.B.I. outta their \\npound of black meat.” \\n\\nSlim said, “Where’s your pad?” \\n\\nI thought fast. It had been a mistake to crack about my pad. If I told them \\nthey could take my whole stash and still bust me or croak me. I was a \\nfugitive. They might even come back to the stash after they took me in. I had \\nthe key to the kitchenette in my pocket. I tested them. \\n\\nI said, “You know Sweet Jones. He’s a friend of mine. I can get four G’s \\nfrom him five minutes after we get to his place. I can’t take you to my pad. I \\ngot a close friend there. Suppose after we got there you’d change your minds \\nabout the deal. You’d have to book him for harboring me.” \\n\\nSlim said, “We can’t cut you loose. We couldn’t do it if you gave us forty \\nG’s. I just remembered you were in that spotlight back there. One of those \\ndowntown men could have made you. Sorry brother, but what the hell? \\nFederal joints ain’t bad to pull a bit in. Thanks for popping up like you did. \\nYou make a great pinch for us.” \\n\\n\\n\\n16 \\n\\nAWAY FROM THE TRACK \\n\\n\\nThey locked me up in central jail. At dawn a jail trusty brought a basket of \\nbologna sandwiches down the line of cells. A moment later another trusty \\nbrought a gigantic kettle of black stinking chicory. I passed up the delicacies. \\n\\nThe tiny cell was too small for two men. Eight of us were in it. I was lying \\non the concrete floor. I was using my rolled up benny as a pillow. My lid \\nshielded my eyes from the bright bare bulb in the corridor. \\n\\nMy cellmates were bums and junkies. Two of them were getting sick. They \\nwere puking all over. The bums were stinking almost as bad as the junkies. A \\ndrunk lying beside me dug his fingernails into his scalp and crotch over and \\nover. He scratched his back against the floor. He had to be lousy. It was \\nrough going for a pimp all right. \\n\\nI thought, “If someone had told me a year ago I’d be back in a shit-house \\nI’d have thought he was nuts. Christ! I hope nothing happens to Chris. She’s \\nthe only link to the outside I can trust to get my clothes and scratch. \\n\\n“I know after she calls and can’t get me at the pad she’ll check out all the \\nshit-houses. It’s a good thing I’m not in the federal lockup at county jail. \\nHere she can grease a mitt and see me. I hope she makes it before the U. S. \\nMarshal shows to move me.” \\n\\nAt nine the turnkey came and called out my name. I went to the cell door. \\nHe looked hard at me through the bar. He twisted the cell-lock open. I \\nstepped out into the corridor and followed him. \\n\\nHe took me to a break-proof glass window with a speaking hole in it. I saw \\nChris on the other side of it. She was crying. I couldn’t blame her. I felt like \\ncrying with her. I bent down and put my mouth to the hole. She stuck an ear \\nagainst it on her side. \\n\\nI said, “Baby, there’s nothing to cry about. You’re Daddy’s brave bitch. \\n\\n\\n\\nremember? Now listen. I want you to give the copper at the property desk a \\ndouble saw or so for the key to my pad. \\n\\n“I want you to get my scratch outta the sleeve of my green trench coat. \\nRent a safe-deposit box. Then move my stuff to your hotel. The Fed’s are \\ngonna take me back to Wisconsin. They call it the point of origin for the \\nrunt’s beef. \\n\\n“They’ll set a bond for me there. I’ll get a slick lip in Wisconsin, Baby you \\nkeep checking. Get to Wisconsin a day before I do with the scratch. I’ll need \\nit for the lip and bail, understand Sugar? Once I get bail, I’ll get our stable \\nback and beat this rap.” \\n\\nI took my jib from the hole and put my horn there. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I’ll do everything the way you say. I understand. Daddy, \\nI’ll go and get the key to your latest hideout. Where did you move? I thought \\nyou were going to wait for my call?” \\n\\nIt didn’t register. Maybe I was cracking up under all the strain and grief. \\nMaybe I had moved before I got busted. I raised my head and looked at her. \\nHer eyes were questioning. I pointed my index finger at the hole. I decided to \\nrisk my theory that I hadn’t moved. \\n\\nI said, “Chris, goddamnit! I haven’t moved! All my stuff is still on West \\nAve. Now come on, girl, this is not the time for jokes from Daddy’s witty \\nbitch. You knocked on the door, I wasn’t there. Naturally, I couldn’t be, I was \\ndown here.” \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, I didn’t have to knock. The door was wide open. Both \\ntrunks and all the suitcases were gone. In fact the only thing left was your \\nhair brush. I put it in my purse. Daddy, all this is too much for me. I must be \\nlosing my mind.” \\n\\nI stood there glaring hate at her. Her eyes were wide, staring at me. \\n\\nI thought, “Poison or Sweet has stolen this Judas-bitch from me. I’m in a \\ncross. One of them has rehearsed this bitch. She’s a sonuvabitching actress. A \\nsucker looking at that innocent look she’s got would have to buy the con. I \\nhate this bitch worse than I do the runt. If I could just get my hands around \\nher throat. I’d love to see her tongue turned black, flopping across her chin. \\n\\n“Well, I can’t croak her through that glass wall. No matter what. I’ve gotta \\nstay Iceberg, I can’t let her take back a chump emotional scene to report. She \\nand her new man are not gonna get their kicks at my expense.” \\n\\nI turned and walked away from her. I saw the turnkey at the far end of the \\ncorridor with his back to me. Good thing for me he hadn’t been close enough \\n\\n\\n\\nto lock me back in the cell right away. I was twenty feet from her when it \\nexploded in my skull. \\n\\nI thought, “It’s the skinny flunky! It’s the skinny flunky! It’s the bastard \\nthat saw me get busted! He rushed back and sprang that spring latch. I gotta \\ngo back to Chris and really play some game. If she gets hip I don’t trust her \\nshe’ll blow for sure. She’s the only stick I got to fight with.” \\n\\nI turned back toward her. She was still standing there. She was crying \\nharder than before. I walked to the glass and spoke into the hole. \\n\\nI said, “Chris, a joker in the building saw me get busted. He cleaned me \\nout. Baby, we’ve been so close. I had a crazy thought that if you’d been there \\nI wouldn’t have been robbed. What the hell, Sugar, I’m the bastard that kept \\nyou away. It wasn’t your fault at all. \\n\\n“Christ! I’ll be glad when this is over. Give a lip here in town a half a yard \\nor so. Have him come to county jail and bring me whatever papers are needed \\nto sell the Hog. Get the slip on the Hog from the property desk. It’s in my \\nwallet. We should get twenty-five hundred or so for it. Bring that scratch and \\nall you can hump up onto Wisconsin.” \\n\\nThey moved me to Wisconsin. Chris came to county jail there and put \\nthree-thousand dollars in my jail account. \\n\\nMama came to see me. She was in pieces. She thought the government was \\ngoing to give me fifty years. \\n\\nAt my hearing, bail was set at twenty-thousand. A bondsman put up the \\nface amount. His fee was two G’s. I got the state’s best criminal lip. I gave \\nhim a G retainer. \\n\\nChris and I went back to the track. I stayed out on bail for four months. I \\nhad two turnouts and three seasoned whores during that time. None stayed \\nlonger than a month. \\n\\nEverybody in the street knew about that rap over my head. I guess the \\nwhores didn’t want to fatten a frog for snakes. Sweet and I didn’t see much of \\neach other. I didn’t feel close to him any more. I was a pimp on the skids. \\nPoison was top pimp. \\n\\nEvery slat I got my hands on I wired to the lip. I had to. I was getting one \\ncontinuance after another. Finally I went to trial. The runt and Ophelia were \\nthere. They were afraid to look at me. They gave the government a \\npenitentiary case all right. \\n\\nThey grinned at each other when I got eighteen months. Mama fainted. \\nChris boo-hooed. I had a good lip though. With the counts against me I could \\n\\n\\n\\nhave gotten ten years. Chris went back to the track. She swore she’d stick \\nuntil I got out. \\n\\nLeavenworth was what the government called a class-A joint. It was big \\nand escape proof. It was run by master psychologists. There was no screw \\nbrutality. It wasn’t necessary. The invisible mental shackles were subtle but \\nharder than the steel bars. Alcatraz was the grim trump the officials held over \\nour heads. \\n\\nIt was a joint of con cliques. The most dangerous clique was the Southern \\ncons. They hated Negroes! \\n\\nI had references as a cellhouse orderly from other joints. I got a spot in a \\ncellhouse with mostly pimps, dope dealers and stick-up men. \\n\\nI was out at night until ten exchanging newspapers and magazines for the \\ncons. I’d been in the joint about six months. I stopped in front of a cell to rap \\nto a pimp pal. He was excited and standing gripping the bars of his cell door. \\nHe was a yellow version of Top. They called him Doll Baby. \\n\\nHe said, “’Berg, you told me I couldn’t steal the beautiful bitch. Well, the \\nbitch sent me a kite this morning. She’s transferring to the shoe shop. I \\nalready got the spot picked out where I can sock it into her. \\n\\n“I told you that square-ass peckerwood she’s got couldn’t out-play me. The \\nbitch is got four bills on the books. She’s getting me a big order on \\ncommissary this week. Shit, on the street or in the joint it’s all the same to \\npimping Doll Baby.” \\n\\nI had seen the beautiful bitch. He was a lanky white boy with watery blue \\neyes and bleached corn-silk hair. A fat red-faced Southern con was madly in \\nlove with him. The beautiful bitch would lie in the fat con’s arms in the yard \\nand pick at the pimples on his face. The con was feared by everyone. He was \\nthe leader of a treacherous band of Southern cons. \\n\\nI said, “Doll, you better cut that bitch loose. Her old man is from \\nMississippi. He’s a cinch to cut your heart out in that yard. He can’t let a \\nNigger steal his broad. Take my advice, pal. I like you. You’ve only a year to \\n\\ngo.” \\n\\nThe next time on the yard I saw Doll and his bitch billing and cooing on \\nthe grass. They didn’t see any of the ball game. The game was over. The fat \\ncon and his band of Southern shiv men had been evil eyeing Doll’s show. I \\nwas fifty yards back of Doll when it happened. \\n\\nHundreds of cons were pressed together filing from the bleachers and \\nplaying field. I saw Doll throw up his hands and scream. He disappeared. The \\n\\n\\n\\ngray tide moved on. Three screws were standing over him. He was on his \\nback. Blood was gushing from his open mouth. Blood seeped from holes in \\nhis jacket. \\n\\nHe lived, but he had a bitch of a time making it. He stayed hitchless for the \\nrest of his bit. \\n\\nChris stopped sending me scratch or anything. I got a wire she’d squared \\nup and married a pullman porter. She even had a baby. I wondered if the \\nsucker knew what a boss bitch he had. \\n\\nI was filing out to sick call one morning. A group of cons on the other side \\nof the road was filing to work. I saw a con marching behind a dark- \\ncomplexioned con raise something that glinted in the sun. It was a shiv. He \\nwas chopping away at the con. Finally the con folded dead. Screws rushed up \\nand took the hatchet man away. \\n\\nI was two months from release. I had stopped to rap to an old con forger \\nwho knew Sweet. We were shooting the breeze about stick-up men and how \\nthey stacked up in the skull department with pimps and con men. We were \\nrapping loud. I knew the night screw was at his desk four tiers down on the \\nground floor. \\n\\nI said, “Pops, a stick-up man is gotta be nuts. The stupid bastard maybe \\npasses a grocery store. He sees the owner checking his till. Right away a \\nstupid idea flashes inside his crazy skull. ‘That’s my scratch.’ \\n\\n“The screwy heist man walks in. Maybe the grocer is a magician or an ex¬ \\nacrobat with a degree in karate, worse an ex-marine. The silly sonuvabitch \\ndoesn’t realize the awful odds. He ain’t got enough in his dim skull to think \\nabout the trillion human elements. Any one of them can put him in his grave. \\nThe suicidal sonuvabitch maybe has his back to the street with his rod in his \\nmitt. Pops, the stick-up man is champ lunatic in the underworld.” \\n\\nPops agreed and I walked away down the tier. I heard a hiss from the cell \\nnext to Pops’. A new transfer was standing at his cell door. He was skinny \\nwith a rat face. I stopped. He was sneering at me. His hands were trying to \\ncrush the rolled-steel bars. \\n\\nHe stuttered, “You you lousy pim-pim-pimp motherfucker. You you pu- \\npu-pussy-eating sonuvabitch. You-you ain’t going to live your bit out.” \\n\\nI went fast to get a rundown on the nut from a stud on the tier below. \\n\\nHe said, “Ah, ’Berg, I hope you haven’t crossed that dizzy bastard. He \\ncroaked a stud in Lewisburg. They hung fifty on him. He’s a heist man. You \\nbetter watch him close. He’s a cinch to make the Rock or loony bin.” \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a week later just after the cellhouse filed out to the shops. The \\ncellhouse screw had signaled “sick call.” I was standing in the back of the \\ncellhouse on the flag. I was lighting a cigarette to smoke before I started \\nmopping and waxing the flag. \\n\\nSomewhere above me an excited voice shouted, “Look out, ’Berg.” \\n\\nI looked up and chilled. A plummeting shadow flashed like black lightning \\nin my eyes. I heard a whooshing whistle as it scraped gently against the cloth \\nof my shirt at the tip of my shoulder. A dozen cymbals clashed as it grenaded \\nagainst the flagstone at my side. I looked down. A steel mop wringer lay in \\nthree pieces. There was a Rorschach crater in the flagstone. Its outline was \\nlike a headshrinker’s blot. \\n\\nI stared at it and idly wondered what the prison head-shrinker could make \\nof it. He was a slick joker. Months ago he had told me, “Pimps have deep \\nmother hatred and severe guilt feelings.” \\n\\nI looked up. It wouldn’t take a head-shrinker to figure this one. The rat¬ \\nfaced heist man was grinning down at me. He was on his gallery on the \\nfourth tier near the ceiling. He had stayed for “sick call” to bomb my skull \\noff. The crater symbol was easy. Rat-face hated pimps without guilt feelings \\ntied in. That night I took a pack of butts to the con who had screamed out the \\nwarning to me. \\n\\nThe nutty bomber went to solitary. Two weeks later he tried to gut a con \\nwith a shiv made from a file. They shipped him to the Rock. I was ecstatic to \\nsee him go. \\n\\nDuring my bit I had read the second cellhouse full of books. I had read \\nmountains of books on psychiatry, psychology, and the psychoneuroses. I \\ncouldn’t have done a smarter thing. I’d have to be my own head-shrinker \\nwhen the white folks entombed me for a year in that steel casket in the future. \\n\\nI got all my good time. I was released in the early spring of nineteen-forty- \\nseven. I stopped off at Mama’s for a week. Then I went back to the fast track. \\n\\nI had sixty slats and the joint vine on my back. The clothes I’d bought \\nwhile on bail were with Chris. Maybe her pullman porter was my size. \\nAnyway, I wasn’t going to do a “Dick Tracy” for a few used vines. \\n\\nSweet was still in the penthouse. He had blown down to only three whores. \\nPoison had made a bad pimping blunder. He had turned out a white square \\nand put his foot in her ass. It was the last straw for the downtown brass. They \\nbounced him off the force. He had one whore. He bird-dogged her. He took \\nhis scratch off after every trick like a Chili Pimp. \\n\\n\\n\\nI rented a pad by the week. It was in the same slum district where the \\nflunky had beat me for my roll and clothes. I had no flash and glamour, no \\npimp front. I was just another pimp down on his luck. I was starving for a \\nwhore. \\n\\nIn a pimp’s life, yesterday means nothing. It’s how you are doing today. A \\npimp’s fame is as fleeting as an icicle under a blow-torch. The young fine \\nwhores are wild to hump for a pimp in the chips. A pimp in bad shape can’t \\nget the time of day from them. A pimp’s wardrobe has to be spectacular. His \\nwheels must be expensive and sparkling new. I had to get the gaudy tools to \\nstart pimping again. \\n\\n\\n\\n17 \\n\\nTRYING A NEW GAME \\n\\n\\nI had three choices. I could cop a piece of stuff on consignment from a \\ncontact I had made in the joint. I could peddle it retail and get nine or ten \\ngrand in weeks. I could take a dog, a broken-down whore with trillions of \\nmileage on her. Maybe I could keep my foot in her ass and grind up a \\nbankroll. \\n\\nI decided to take the third out. Do a slick fast hustle. I met a pimp named \\nRed Eye in a junkie joint. He had just finished a state bit the week before. He \\nwas whoreless like me and itching to pimp again. We were crying on each \\nother’s shoulder at the bar. \\n\\nHe said, “Ice, ain’t it a bitch? No matter how much pimp a stud is, these \\ndizzy bitches demand he’s got a front. Now we ain’t hustlers, but I got an \\nidea. Ice, you’re a helluva actor and you can rap good as a con man. I know a \\nstud who’s hip to every smack peddler and fence on the West Side. I got a \\nrod and a real copper’s shield. \\n\\n“All we need is a Short and a third stud to drive. Neither one of us is well \\nknown over there. Besides, there’s a flock of youngsters dealing now who \\nwere squares when we left the track. I’m a rollertype stud. With the weight \\nyou put on in the joint you’d make a perfect copper. \\n\\n“Ice, if we only knock over three of ’em, we split maybe ten to fifteen G’s \\nbetween us. Our finger man is a junkie punk. We give him and the driver \\npeanuts. Ice, those forty-seven Hogs are a pimp’s dream. I gotta have one. \\nWhatta you say? Are you in?” \\n\\nI said, “Red Eye, I’ll go for it. I sure as hell ain’t going to put a mop in my \\nhand out here. I don’t have wheels, but I’ve got a little scratch. I’ll spring to \\nrent a short. You know someone with one? How about a driver?” \\n\\nHe said, “Ice, lay a double saw on me to cop a short. I know a stud for the \\n\\n\\n\\ndriver. Meet me right here in this joint tomorrow night at nine. We can take \\noff our first mark.” \\n\\nI said, “Don’t crack my name to that driver. Call me Tom, Frank, \\nanything.” \\n\\nI didn’t get two-hours sleep that night. It worried me to be part of a hustle \\nthat required a rod. \\n\\nI thought, “Maybe I’d better back out. I could maybe find a young hash- \\nslinger in a greasy spoon. I could turn her out in a hurry. She’d be a long shot \\nfor stardom. At least she’d make enough scratch for chump expenses. \\n\\n“You can’t start pimping with a turnout. It never works out. A pimp with \\nno whore and no bankroll is a sucker to try the turnout on a mulish square \\nbroad. No, I guess the Red Eye deal is all I got.” \\n\\nRed Eye got to the joint at ten-thirty. The driver was a huge stud with a \\nrapper like a girl’s. I noticed his big meat-hooks shaking on the steering \\nwheel on our way to the West Side. Red Eye ran down our first mark. His \\nlight-maroon eyes were whirling. He had a skull full of H. \\n\\nHe said, “Paul, our first mark is a bird’s nest on the ground. It’s a broad. \\nThe finger showed her to me last night. She and her old man got the best \\nsmack on the West Side. It’s so good studs from all over town are rushing to \\ncop every night. \\n\\n“He and the broad deal out of a bar three blocks from their pad. They deal \\nmostly in eights and sixteenths. On a weekend night like this one they take \\noff maybe five G’s. The stud is got a rep as a fast-rod joker. He ain’t got no \\ndirect syndicate connections as far as I know. \\n\\n“We ain’t got to worry about him tonight. He’s in New York copping a \\nsupply. The broad will leave the bar around midnight loaded with scratch. \\nShe’ll have a few packs of smack on her too for the evidence to shake her. \\nHer real name is Mavis Sims. \\n\\n“She’s gonna go to her short parked behind the bar. She ain’t afraid of \\nbeing heisted. Everybody is scared shitless of her old man. She’s got a small \\nrod strapped to her thigh. She ain’t going to pull it on the police though. \\nThat’s us, strange rollers from downtown. We gotta move fast on her when \\nshe bits that lot behind the bar. She’s a slick bitch. We gotta be real rollers. \\nWe can’t wake her up we’re fakes. She’s a strong bitch. I’d have to blow a \\nhole in her if she reached for her rod. \\n\\n“There will be a pack of hard studs in the bar. They would love to croak us \\non that lot to please her old man. We gotta move her fast outta the \\n\\n\\n\\nneighborhood to play her outta the scratch. We gotta be careful the rollers \\ndon’t join our party. Her old man is doing a lot of greasing in the district. \\n\\n“Perry is gonna park our short in the street beside the lot. We arrest the \\nbroad and you play on her while Perry drives. I ain’t going to rap. Ice, after \\nwe cop her it’s up to you for the shake. You got to convince her.” \\n\\nPerry was really nervous. He pulled into the curb next to the bar lot. His \\nskull was jiggling on his bull neck like he had Parkinson shakes. I was silent. \\n\\nRed Eye’s rundown had me wondering how it shaped up as a bird’s nest to \\nhim. It looked like maybe a bird’s nest for Dillinger. If the mark hadn’t been \\na broad I’d have split and got on an El train. \\n\\nI wondered if she’d seen me before I went to the joint. What if she made \\nme right away as Iceberg and plugged me in the skull. Her old man might \\nhave outfit friends. If he did we’d be found in an alley with our balls rammed \\ndown our throats. We were standing in the shadows ten feet from the broad’s \\nshort. \\n\\nI said, “Red, I better take the rod. When we step out on her, shine the \\nflashlight right in her eyes.” \\n\\nShe was walking fast when she came into the lot. Her light blue chiffon \\ndress was billowing in the April breeze. She was walking wide-legged like a \\nwhore after a long night in a two-dollar house. \\n\\nMy legs were trembling like a stud dog’s hung up in a bitch. I looked down \\nat the badge pinned to the wallet in my palm. It glittered like molten silver in \\nthe moonlight. The thirty-two pistol in my right hand weighed a sweaty ton. \\n\\nShe was twirling a key ring. In the utter silence the clinking sounded like \\nthe U.S. Marshal’s handcuffs. She had her hands on the door handle. I \\nstepped out of the shadows. Red Eye was behind me. I wondered if she could \\nhear my ticker hammering. Red Eye put the light in her face. Her yellow \\nforehead wrinkled in surprise. Her sexy jib flapped open. I grabbed her wrist \\nand tried to crush it. \\n\\nI roared, “Police! What’s your name and why are you sneaking around \\nback here?” \\n\\nShe stammered, “Gloria Jones, and I was coming to my car. I always park \\nit here. Now get out of the way. I’m going home. The captain of this district \\nis a personal friend of my husband’s.” \\n\\nRed Eye had turned off the flashlight and moved behind her. She was \\nlooking down at the badge. She was trying to yank her wrist free. \\n\\nI said in a low heavy voice, “You lying dope-peddling bitch. Your real \\n\\n\\n\\nmoniker is Mavis Sims. We’re from downtown. Your old man’s no pal of \\nours. We’re gonna bust you, bitch. I’ll lay odds we’ve caught you dirty. \\nCome on bitch, before we get rough. Anything I hate it’s a stinking smack \\ndealer.” \\n\\nWe hurled her into the back seat of our short. Red got in beside her. I was \\nup front with Perry. I turned facing the rear seat. There was silence as Perry \\ndrove out of the district toward central headquarters. Miss Sims was \\nsquirming in the seat. Her right hand was out of sight behind her. She was \\ngetting very jerky. I remembered that rod she was carrying. I started the \\nshake. \\n\\nI said, “AI, this suspect is acting peculiarly. Perhaps you’d better pull over. \\nShe might have concealed some evidence behind the seat.” \\n\\nHe pulled over. Red moved toward her. She slid to the window on the \\nother side. \\n\\nShe said, “Officers, I’m clean. It’s worth fifty apiece to cut me loose. If \\nyou bust me. I’ll be out in an hour. Take me back to the bar. I can get the \\nhundred and fifty from the bar owner.” \\n\\nI said, “No dice, sister. We got specific orders to bring you in. Now don’t \\nmake him slap a broad around. He’s gonna frisk you. He don’t have to wait \\nfor a matron to do it downtown. It’s proper if he thinks you’re armed and \\nwe’re in danger.” \\n\\nHe patted the inside of her thighs. It was there, a twenty-two automatic \\njammed under the top of her stocking. He took it out and shoved it in his \\npocket, searched her bosom, purse, shoes, and hair. She was sure clean except \\nfor the rod. \\n\\nI felt like a real chump. All this trouble for nothing. He was scratching his \\nchin. The junkie punk had put a bum finger on the broad. \\n\\nI was at the point of shoving her out. Then it struck me. Where did my \\nstreet whores hide their scratch? In the cat! In the cat, where else? The \\nclincher was this broad’s wide-legged walk. I had noticed it on the lot. She \\nwas leaning forward staring at Perry’s face. \\n\\nI said, “Joe, it’s gotta be up her cat. Bitch, stretch out and put your legs \\nacross his lap.” \\n\\nShe said, “The hell I will. You phony Niggers ain’t rollers. That big one at \\nthe wheel used to bounce at Mario’s.” \\n\\nShe was wise. The double saw I gave Red Eye had tapped me out. We had \\nto know if she had treasure up her cat. \\n\\n\\n\\nI wondered how he’d handle it. I didn’t wonder long. He turned brute. He \\npunched her hard in the nose. It was like he had cut her throat. Blood \\nsplattered over the front of her dress. I felt a light spray on my face. \\n\\nShe opened her mouth to scream. He smothered it with a terrible slam to \\nthe gut. She went limp. He pulled her across him. He darted his paw between \\nher legs. \\n\\nWhen he brought his mitt out it made a kissing sound. He had a long shiny \\nplastic tube between his index and middle fingers. It stank like rotten fish. \\n\\nThe broad was moaning and holding both hands to her nose. He \\nunwrapped the package. The pouch was bursting with scratch. In the center \\nof the roll I saw the cellophane edges of packaged dope. \\n\\nHe got out and opened the door on the broad’s side. He dragged her out to \\nthe sidewalk. He got in the front seat. Perry gunned away. I kept a sharp eye \\non Red Eye as he counted the scratch in his lap. \\n\\nRed Eye and I netted two grand apiece. Red Eye took the packages of H. \\nThe broad dealer had forty-four hundred in the pouch. Perry and the junkie \\nfinger man got two bills apiece. \\n\\nIt was a week before we tried for the second mark. We shouldn’t have. He \\nwas a reefer peddler and fence. We thought he had big scratch on him. We \\ndidn’t have a driver. We had the mark in the short. Red Eye was driving. \\n\\nWe were playing the peel off. The mark was in the back seat. I was in the \\nfront seat. I asked for his identification. He handed me his hide. I saw it had \\nonly a few slats in it. \\n\\nWe were pulling to the curb to search him. A two-man squad car passed. \\nThe mark saw them and started screaming. They stopped and dragged Red \\nEye and me out to the street. They kicked and beat hell out of us. They took \\nus down. \\n\\nThe mark was slick. Right there on the street he cracked. We took a C note \\nfrom him. If he’d known about our roll, he could have beefed for four G’s. \\n\\nThe rollers saw our rolls and tried to pin every stick-up on the books \\nagainst us. We went on every show-up for a week. We didn’t get a finger. \\nThey booked us for armed robbery of the mark. \\n\\n\\n\\n18 \\n\\nJAILBREAK \\n\\n\\nAn agent for a fixer came to the lockup. He assured us we could avoid five \\nto ten for armed robbery. We could get the charge reduced to a workhouse bit \\nfor a price. \\n\\nWe tapped out and got a year apiece in the workhouse. It was like a prison, \\nonly tougher. A joint is always rough when there’s graft and corruption. Only \\ncons with scratch are treated and fed like human beings. The walls were just \\nas high. Most of the inmates were serving short thirty and ninety-day bits. \\n\\nThe joint was filthy. The food was unbelievable. The officials had an \\nunfunny habit of putting pimps on the coal pile. I did a week on it. I was \\nready to make a blind rush at the wall. Maybe I could claw up the thirty feet \\nbefore I got shot. I was really desperate. \\n\\nAfter the first week I came out of shock. I started thinking about a sensible \\nway to escape. I just couldn’t get my skull in shape for another bit. It was too \\nsoon after the last one. By the middle of the second week I’d had a dozen \\nideas. None of them stood up under second thoughts. \\n\\nI shared a tiny cell with a young con. He was only eighteen. He idolized \\nme. He’d heard about me in the streets. I slept on the top of a double bunk. \\nThere were three counts. One in the morning, one after night lockup, the third \\nat midnight. \\n\\nOne night I missed standing up for count at the cell door. I was so beat \\nfrom heaving coal I’d collapsed on my bunk. I woke up an hour after the \\ncount. It gave me an idea. I kicked it around in my skull. Like all good ideas \\nit kept growing, crying out for my attention. \\n\\nI thought, “I wonder how much and what of me that screw saw when he \\ncounted me?” I tested him three nights in a row. I’d lie on the bunk when he \\ncame through to count. Each time I’d lie so he saw less of me. The last time \\n\\n\\n\\nhe counted me there was only my back, rear end, and legs visible to him. \\n\\nI got excited. I knew it would be easy to get extra pants and a shirt. I could \\nstuff them into a passable dummy. I knew my first problem was to find a way \\nto get out of line when filing from the coal pile. \\n\\nMy second problem was I couldn’t leave a dummy in position in the cell \\nduring the day. Cellhouse cons and screws would pass on the gallery and \\ndiscover it. I decided to solve my outside problem first. \\n\\nAt the end of the day a screw would line us up at the coal pile to be \\ncounted. We would then file two-hundred yards into the mess hall for supper. \\nAfter supper we would file through hallways to the cell house for count. \\n\\nThere were several cellhouses. All of the cellhouses phoned in their tallies \\nto the office. If all the tallies equaled that number of cons in the entire joint \\nthen the count was right. A loud whistle blew and the day screws could go \\nhome. \\n\\nThere was no cover between the coal pile and the mess hall. A screw with \\na scoped, high-powered rifle manned a wall that ran parallel to our line of \\nmarch. It looked impossible. I lost hope. On my twenty-eighth day in the \\njoint I noticed something. \\n\\nI had been on an official pass-out of some kind. It was very near supper \\ntime. I passed the dress-in station and shower room. The front door was open. \\nI glanced in. In the rear of it a screw was hooklocking a wooden door. \\n\\nI stopped and pretended to tie my shoe. He then walked up two or three \\nstairs and swung a steel door shut inside the shower room. He started lining \\nup his cons for the march to the dining room. \\n\\nI had noticed the shed before on the marches to the dining room. It was \\nmaybe thirty feet from the line of march. The door had always been shut. I \\nhad thought it stayed locked all the time. I couldn’t have checked it with that \\nrifleman on the wall and a screw marching with me. \\n\\nIn the cell that night I was as excited as a crumb crusher at Christmas time. \\n\\nI thought, “Maybe that shower screw sometimes forgets to lock that shed \\ndoor. Maybe he’s even later locking it than today. I couldn’t see what the hell \\nwas in the shed. I know there’s gotta be old clothing or something. I can hide \\nunder when he comes to hook that slammer. I gotta get outta this joint. I can’t \\npull my bit here. \\n\\n“If the kid will handle the dummy end, I’ll take a chance. I’m gonna talk to \\nmy cellmate about that dummy. If he’ll help me, I can escape like a shadow.” \\n\\nI looked down over the rim of my bunk at him. I had written several \\n\\n\\n\\nbullshit letters for him to his girlfriend. So far they had kept her writing and \\nsending him candy and cigarette money. He was a good kid. I didn’t think \\nhe’d rat. \\n\\nI said, “Shorty, what if I told you I could beat this joint?” \\n\\nHe said, “Iceberg, you’re jiving. You can’t make it out of here. There are \\nfive steel gates between this cell and the streets. How’re you planning to do \\nit?” \\n\\nI said, “Kid, as beautiful as it is I can’t do it without your help. Now here it \\nis.” \\n\\nI ran it down to him. At first he was leery. I told him to take the dummy \\nfrom the floor under his bunk. Put it on mine. As soon as the whistle blew, \\nunstuff the shirt and pants. Put the blanket stuffing back on my bunk. \\nSometime during the night before the midnight count, throw the pants and \\nshirt over the gallery to the flagstone. \\n\\nWhen the midnight hell broke loose he’d be clean. No one could prove or \\neven suspect he had dismantled the dummy. I asked him to give me the name \\nof a relative for record. I told him I would send him a C note from the first \\nwhore scratch I got. \\n\\nI got his promise to handle the cell end of the plan. An hour later I gave a \\ncellhouse orderly two packs of butts for an extra blanket. I had the stuffing. I \\ntook off my shirt and pants and stuffed them for rehearsal. He sat at the cell \\ndoor with a mirror watching the gallery both ways. In twenty minutes he had \\nthe position and the rest of it down pat. \\n\\nI didn’t close my eyes all night. At midnight I saw the screw counting \\nheads. He was due for a shock soon. I knew that if something went wrong \\nthey’d probably beat me to death out there on the yard. I had to go through \\nwith it. No con misses his freedom more than a pimp. His senses are addicted \\nto silky living. \\n\\nI took packs of butts to the coal pile the next day. A yard runner got me a \\nshirt and pants. I put them on over the ones I wore. That night in the cell I \\nmade up the dummy. I put it under the kid’s bunk and gave him a pep talk \\nuntil midnight. I even promised him I’d keep in touch and when he got out \\nI’d teach him to pimp. \\n\\nI thought the last day on the coal pile would never end. I would be sunk if \\nthere was a routine cellhouse shakedown. Finally we lined up. My throat was \\ndry and my knees were wobbly. We were approaching that shed. The screw \\non the wall walked twenty paces away. Then about faced and walked back \\n\\n\\n\\nfacing the coal pile gang. \\n\\nI’d have to break for the shed when he walked away. I’d have to be in there \\nwhen he turned if it wasn’t locked. If he didn’t shoot me, the yard screws \\nwould beat me to a pulp. The coal-pile screw was ahead of me. He could turn \\nand look back at any moment. No other moment in my life has been so tense, \\nso wildly adventuresome. I didn’t even know if there wasn’t a fink in the line. \\nI tell you it was something. If my ticker had been faulty I’d have passed out. \\n\\nThe screw on the wall was walking away. The shed seemed miles away. I \\nslipped out of line and raced for it. I could hear an excited whispering from \\nthe cons behind me. I touched the shed doorhandle. For an instant I hesitated. \\nI was afraid I’d find it locked. My sweat-hot hands pulled it toward me. It \\nwas open! \\n\\nJust before I stepped inside I looked up at the wall. The screw was standing \\nlooking in the direction of the shed. I shut the door. Had he seen me? I looked \\naround the shed. There was nothing to hide under or behind. I could hear the \\ncons in the shower room. They were getting ready for supper. \\n\\nThe steel door was half open. That screw would be out at any second to \\nhook the shed door. There was no place to hide. It had been all for nothing. I \\nheard a voice and the scrape of feet at the steel door. The screw was coming \\nout into the shed! I looked up at the shed ceiling. I looked over the steel door. \\n\\nThere was a line of rusty bars a foot long over the door flush against a \\ngrimy window. I leaped up and grabbed two of them. I swung my feet and \\nlegs up just as the screw walked in to lock the door. I was jack-knifing my \\nlegs just six inches from the top of his blue uniform cap. I hung there like a \\nbat. I held my breath. He passed beneath me. I saw flakes of rust fall from the \\nbars onto the top of his cap. It seemed forever to my agonized aching arms \\nand legs. \\n\\nI heard the steel door crash shut. I started breathing again. I hung up there \\nfor another long moment. He might come back for some reason. I swung my \\nparalyzed legs down and released my grip on the bars. I sat on the stone steps \\nfighting for breath. The shed was quiet as a tomb. I could hear my ticker \\nstaccato. \\n\\nThe worse wasn’t over. That “all is well” whistle had to blow. If it didn’t \\nblow they’d come looking for me with fists, clubs, and guns. I peeped \\nthrough a crack in the door. I put my ear to it. The yard was bare. I could hear \\nthe clatter of steel plates in the mess hall. Finally all was quiet. The count was \\ngoing on. \\n\\n\\n\\nI thought, “Even if the kid goes through with his end, this one night the \\ncount screw will poke that dummy to stand up to the cell door. That whistle \\nain’t gonna blow. It’s been too long already. Those cold-hearted bastards are \\non the way already. They’ll beat and stomp me crippled.” \\n\\nThe whistle blew! The beautiful sound of it was like a faucet. It flooded \\nmy eyes with tears. I did a dusty jig on the shed floor. It was dusk. It wasn’t \\nover. The only way to get over the wall was to scale and climb to the top of a \\ncellhouse in the far corner of the yard. \\n\\nLucky for me the cellhouse sat in a deep recess, otherwise its roof would \\nhave towered above the wall. It was the only building close to a section of \\nwall. Other buildings stairs stepped almost to the roof of the cellhouse. \\nMaybe I’d been too eager to escape. I’d not put together a rope or hook. I’d \\nhave to use hands and feet. It sat six feet away and twenty feet above the \\nwall. \\n\\nThere was only one screw on the wall after the count cleared. He’d be in \\nhis cubicle reading the newspaper or a magazine. If he looked up he couldn’t \\nmiss seeing me in the glare of the yard lights. \\n\\nMy uniform was dark green, stained black with coal dust. Maybe on the \\nstreet I’d look like any sooty steel mill or coal worker. I hadn’t done too \\nbadly so far with short-term planning. \\n\\nI had until midnight to get over the wall and out of the city. I had no \\nscratch. I’d passed out a small fortune in tips to hotel maids, bellhops, and \\nbartenders. Now all of them were rich compared to me. I knew several I \\ncould go to and get a few dollars. They could be found at their places of \\nwork. \\n\\nThere had been all the show-ups the month before and after my conviction. \\nMy face would be remembered by the rollers in those neighborhoods. I \\nthought about Sweet. I remembered his crack at the hideout to set me up for \\nthe cop of my stable. I threw him out of my skull. \\n\\nI couldn’t trust any of the pimps I knew. I’d always been a threat to them. \\nIceberg was really on his own. I’d have to make it to one of Mama’s sisters, \\nthirty miles away in Indiana. \\n\\nIt was now pitch black inside the shed. I raised the hook and pushed the \\ndoor open. I looked out into the yard. I stepped through the door into the \\nyard. All was quiet. I pushed the door shut. I heard a dull metallic noise. I \\npulled it toward me. The hook had fallen into its loop. The shed door had \\nhooked from the inside. \\n\\n\\n\\nI thought, “That freak accident would confound the investigators for sure.” \\n\\nI raced to the side of the mess hall. I’d have to get on its flat roof. I took \\nhold of some window bars and pulled up to a standing position on the sill, I \\nreached over and grabbed the drain pipe. I swung over and shinnied up to the \\nroof. \\n\\nI looked to my left. I could see the silhouetted figure of the wall screw in \\nhis cubicle. I looked across and up at the cellhouse roof abutting the wall. It \\nwas a long way. I walked across the roof toward the next building. I was near \\nthe far edge of the roof. I looked back at the wall cubicle. The screw was out \\nwalking the wall. He had that deadly rifle cradled in his arms. \\n\\nI flung myself flat on my back on the black roof. I hoped I was invisible to \\nhim. I lay there panting. I wondered what a screw’s manual said about an \\nescaping con target. If he saw me would he scope for a skull, heart, or gut \\nshot? \\n\\nFinally he went back into the cubicle. Lucky for me the mess-hall roof was \\nconnected to the chapel building. The connection was a concrete ledge. It was \\nless than a foot wide and about twelve feet long. My heavy prison brogans \\nseemed as wide as the ledge. They slipped on the glazed ledge. The wild late \\nApril winds made the walk as secure as a stroll across a teeter-totter two \\nstories above the ground. \\n\\nI stood at the end of the ledge and looked up. I stretched my right arm up \\nand stood on tip-toes. The chapel roof was two feet above my fingertips. I’d \\nhave to go back a few feet on that glassy ledge. I’d have to get up enough \\nspeed coming back to make a twofeet leap. I’d have to grab the outside rim of \\nthe roof’s drain gutter. I wondered if it could stand my weight. \\n\\nI carefully backed up six feet. I stood there trembling looking up at the rim. \\nI looked back. The screw wasn’t on the wall. I had to forget how narrow the \\nledge was. I threw a leg out. I whipped the other toward it. I pumped them \\nover the gritty glaze. I heard the whispering hiss of the leather soles tromping \\nthe ledge. My arms were outstretched to the black sky. My eyes were riveted \\nupward to the gutter rim. \\n\\nI leaped upward. I felt my feet soar off the ledge. I taloned the rim. I hung \\nfrom it dangling in space. My fingernails sent red-hot needles of pain through \\nthe tortured flesh at their roots. I chinned up and hurled a leg across the roof \\ntop. I rolled onto it. I lay there gasping as I watched the rifleman walk his \\nbeat. He went in. \\n\\nI struggled up the steep sloping roof to the top. The edge of the cellhouse \\n\\n\\n\\nroof was three feet away. I leaped straight ahead. I flopped on my belly. The \\ntips of my brogans were in the drain gutter. The cellhouse roof was even \\nsteeper. It was coated with squares of slippery shale. I looked up toward the \\ntop. It seemed a city block away. I started bellying up it. I dug my brogan tips \\ninto the small cracks between the shale squares. \\n\\nI finally inched to the top. My chest was flaming. I lay astraddle the six- \\ninch top of a double precipice. The two sides of the roof formed a steep \\npyramid. I was on top of it. The six-inch top seemed as thin as a wire. \\nThrough a dizzy haze I saw the lights of the city winking in an ocean of \\nblackness. \\n\\nI got to my feet. I started walking the tight wire like a circus performer. \\nThe winds were savage up here. They kicked and punched me. I teetered and \\nswayed on the wire. I looked down over the right precipice to the street far \\nbelow. Through a fuzzy blur I saw auto headlights darting through the night \\nlike tiny fireflies. My skull almost blacked out. I jerked my skull away and \\nglued my eyes to the wire. \\n\\nIt was like an age before I reached the end of the cellhouse. If the screw \\ncame out now I’d be in full view. Even from the inside he could spot me. I \\nstood shivering. I looked down twenty feet to the top of the three-foot wide \\nwall. I couldn’t turn back. I couldn’t just stand there. It was a cinch I couldn’t \\nexpect to keep balance if I hit the wall feet first. \\n\\nI dropped, legs opened wide. I heard my trousers rip. The inside concrete \\nedge of the wall top gouged into my inner thigh. My rear end crashed against \\nthe concrete. My skull reeled in pain as I sat in the cold saddle. I swung my \\ngouged left leg from the inner side of the wall. I scooted back on my belly to \\nmy fingertips. \\n\\nI hung there for a moment. I felt blood running down my left leg into my \\nshoe. I let go. I struck feet first. My butt and back took the rest of the shock. I \\nlay there on my back in a drunken fog of exhaustion, pain and breathless joy. \\n\\nIt was at least ten minutes before I could stand. I limped away for a \\nhundred yards. I turned and looked back at the joint. \\n\\nI thought, “Those dirty white folks are gonna pace the floor. Their assholes \\nare gonna twitch. They’re gonna call me a million black-Nigger bastards and \\nsonuvabitches. One thing they can’t deny in their cruel secret hearts. I \\noutsmarted them. It’s gonna hurt ’em to the rotten quick that a Nigger did a \\nblack Houdini outta here. No screws’ skulls busted and no bars sawed. \\n\\n“They’re gonna foul their chances to catch me after the midnight count. \\n\\n\\n\\nThey’ll search the yard and joint for a week. Their asses will turn blue. Their \\nskulls won’t let ’em believe a Nigger was clever enough to ghost outta here.” \\n\\nI turned and hobbled toward the State of Indiana. \\n\\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\nTHE ICE PICK \\n\\n\\nI was lucky. I caught five rides to get to my Aunt. It was five minutes to \\nmidnight when she opened the door. At first she didn’t recognize me. She \\nmade me welcome. \\n\\nIn a week my leg had healed and I felt strong. Her husband was my size. \\nHe gave me an outfit and fifty dollars. I went to the whore section of town. A \\nbunch of New Orleans pimps were in town. They had their thieving whores \\nwith them. Three days later I stole one. \\n\\nHer name was No Thumbs Helen. She was at that time one of the slickest \\n“from the person” thieves in the country. We got about in a forty-seven Hog. \\nShe was a magician. For almost a year she left a trail of empty wallets across \\nfive states. \\n\\nWe were in Iowa when Helen stung a rich sod-buster for seventy-two \\nhundred. I was in bed when she threw it on the bed. Excited? Sure I was. My \\nheart boomed like bombs going off. She didn’t know it. I was icy cool. I \\ncasually scooped it up and counted it. I had a poker face. \\n\\nI said, “Now listen, bitch. Run this sting down. I gotta know how hot this \\nscratch is. Did you get all the sucker had? I’ll be a salty sonuvabitch to read \\nin the papers that you missed a bundle.” \\n\\nHer rundown told me it was best to split. We got in the Hog and went to \\nMinneapolis. The second day I copped a young whore. She wanted to be a \\nthief. I took her to Helen at our hotel. Helen chilled when she saw the pretty \\nbitch. \\n\\nShe blew her top. She drew her knife. The young whore fled. I disarmed \\nHelen and punched her around. Helen went to work. I fell asleep. I woke up \\nfast. Helen was jabbing her knife into me. I rolled away. She had stabbed me \\nin the forearm and the side of an elbow. I took a golf club and knocked her \\n\\n\\n\\nout. \\n\\nI never tried to stable her after that. I didn’t feel like a real pimp with one \\nwhore. I decided to steal the technique of stealing from Helen. I could use it \\nto train other whores when I cut her loose. Finally I picked her skull. The \\ntechnique went as follows. \\n\\nShe would lurk in some shadowy doorway or alley entrance. When a trick \\ncame by she’d go into a con act. She’d stand wide-legged and bend her knees \\nto an almost squatting stance. She’d whip up the front bottom of her dress. \\nShe’d expose the gaping, hairy magnet to the bugging eyes of the sucker. The \\npull was magnified by her stroking her cat. \\n\\nShe’d say to the sucker, “Please pretty sweetie, I am so hot this pussy is \\nburning up. I ain’t had no dick in six months. Come here and do something to \\nit.” \\n\\nHe’d step into the doorway already blind hot to sock it in for free. His \\ninstinctive weariness blackjacked to sleep by the raw event. She’d bombard \\nthe sucker with a flow of sweetly passionate sexy bullshit as she tightly \\nembraced him. \\n\\nShe had located his wallet, usually in a rear trouser pocket, with the \\nsensitive tips of her fingers. She’d dry grind her belly against his scrotum. \\nShe’d complain that his belt buckle was hurting her. She would be panting in \\nphony passion as she unbuckled it. It would release the tension on his pants \\npockets. She’d caress the head of his swipe with her fingers. \\n\\nShe’d stroke the tip of his ear with her tongue. The very tips of the airy \\nlight index finger and thumb of the free hand flicked the buttoned pocket \\nopen. The index and middle fingers scissored on the wallet and slid it from \\nthe pocket. The trick would be excited and hot. He wouldn’t have felt the \\nglowing end of a cigarette on his ass. \\n\\nWith both hands behind his neck, she’d remove the scratch from the hide. \\nShe’d up the sexy chatter and the strong grind against his scrotum. She’d roll \\nthe bills into a tight suppository shape. She’d slip the wallet back into the \\npocket. She wouldn’t forget to rebutton the pocket. She was ready to blow the \\nsucker off, get rid of him. She’d crack that she had to pee. Stooping quickly, \\nshe’d ram the rolled bills up her cat. She’d sight a passing car. She’d fake \\nalarm. \\n\\nShe would say, “Oh my God. There’s Riley, the vice cop. Listen honey, go \\nto the Park Hotel up the street and register as Mr. and Mrs. Jones. I will be \\nthere in ten minutes. Pretty Daddy. I sure want some of your good dick.” \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sucker would pat the reassuring bump of his wallet. It was still there in \\nthe buttoned pocket. He’d amble off to the hotel. The thief would make it \\nhome. She’d completely change her appearance. She’d go back into the street \\nto sting another sucker. \\n\\nThere was an accident. She got pregnant. I found a croaker who made her \\none again. The game went down as usual. The bubble burst in a small town in \\nOhio. \\n\\nThe sky-rocket came crashing down when I ran into an old pal. He was \\nnow called New York Joe. I hadn’t seen him since I was fourteen. My mother \\nhad taken him in for a few weeks when his widowed-mother died. He got \\nsick and had to go to a hospital. I’d take a bus to see him and bring him tid¬ \\nbits. I’d sit with him and console him. I liked him. Our friendship was brief. \\nHe got out of the hospital and left town. \\n\\nHe was wholesaling cocaine and the sample he gave me was almost pure. I \\nmade an appointment to cop a piece. I didn’t know he had learned in New \\nYork to cross everybody, even old friends. I found out the stuff he gave me \\nwas phony. I rushed back to him figuring he had made a mistake and would \\nsquare things with me. I said, “Joe, you’ve made a mistake, man.” He took \\nme inside. He said, “What’s the trouble, Jim?” \\n\\nI said, “Man, this is bullshit. This ain’t the same stuff that I sampled.” \\n\\nHe said, “Well listen, Ronald went out to the stash. That mother-fucker is \\ncrossing me.” \\n\\nHe drew his gun from a shoulder holster. At the time I didn’t know it was \\nall con. \\n\\nHe said, “Should I go out there and kill that sonuvabitch? What do you \\nwant me to do?” \\n\\nHe started working his eyes. His eyes were bugging and going through all \\nthat crazy act. \\n\\nI said, “No man, just give me my scratch back.” \\n\\nHe said, “I’m so mad I should croak you both.” \\n\\nI was relatively young. I had never run into this New York stuff before. I \\nwas spooked. \\n\\nI said, “Forget about it.” \\n\\nHe was going through contortions. I was in his town. I had a thief with at \\nleast seven beefs on her. I was out the three grand. I might have gotten \\ncroaked. Later I knew it was stuff: New York stuff. In later years, I figured it \\nout. He maybe had always hated me because I had more education than he \\n\\n\\n\\nhad. \\n\\nA week later Helen got busted on seven counts. I signed the Hog over to a \\nlip. She got five to ten. I should have wired a bomb to the starter before I \\nturned it over to the lip. \\n\\nA stud told me Joe had fingered Helen. He almost ruined me. He tapped \\nme out, got my thief busted. He literally ran me out of town broke, and with \\nno whore. \\n\\nI heard whore-catching was good in Detroit. I took my last tendollar bill \\nand caught a Greyhound. Detroit was the promised land for pimps all right. \\nThe town was teeming with young fast whores. The local pimps were soft \\ncompetition. \\n\\nI was walking, but I was sharp as a Harlem sissy. Anyway, these whores \\nwere a different breed than the ones back in the city. They were gullible, and \\na fellow didn’t have to play his heart out to cop them. \\n\\nThe first package I copped was a beautiful seventeen-year-old green-eyed \\nversion of Pepper. Her name was Rachel. I was to keep her thirteen years. \\n\\nMy next package was a huge, black, dangerous jasper named Serena. In \\naddition to being a whore, she ran a fast sheet setup for a dozen whores. They \\ntricked out of her joint. Within eight weeks after I hit Detroit I was cruising \\nthe streets in a sparkling new forty-eight Fleetwood. I had a fat bankroll. \\n\\nWithin ninety days after the Serena cop, I had copped two more young \\nbroads. A week later a small-time pimp came to town from Rhode Island. He \\nhad a beautiful young whore with him. He was jealous. He followed her in \\nthe street. I stalked her. He forgot to follow her. I stole her. I’d had her \\nseveral months when the town got shaky. The rollers forced Serena out of her \\njoint. I put her in the street. \\n\\nThen I heard about a small town in Ohio—Lima—that was jumping with \\ngood tricks and wide open. I could possibly open up a couple of houses there. \\n\\nMy luck was soaring. With my pad rent and a pad a piece for the girls, I \\nneeded a tighter setup to cut down my nut. My skull was whirling as I drove \\nthe Hog to pick up my stable in the street. They got in. I tossed their scratch \\nin the glove compartment. \\n\\nDawn was breaking as the big Hog scooted through the streets. My five \\nwhores were chattering like drunk magpies. I smelled that stink that only a \\nstreet whore has after a long, busy night. The inside of my nose was raw. It \\nhappens when you’re a pig for snorting cocaine. \\n\\nMy nose was on fire. The stink of those whores and the gangster they were \\n\\n\\n\\nsmoking seemed like invisible knives scraping to the root of my brain. I was \\nin an evil, dangerous mood despite that pile of scratch crammed into the \\nglove compartment. \\n\\n“Goddamnit, has one of you bitches shit on herself or something?” I \\nbellowed. I flipped the wing window toward me. \\n\\nFor a long moment there was silence. Then Rachel, my bottom whore, \\ncracked in a pleasing-ass kissing voice, “Daddy Baby, that ain’t no shit you \\nsmell. We been turning all night. Ain’t no bathrooms in those tricks’ cars we \\nbeen flipping out of. Daddy, we sure been humping for you. What you smell \\nis our nasty whore asses.” \\n\\nI grinned widely, inside of course. The best pimps keep a steel lid on their \\nemotions. I was one of the iciest. The whores went into fits of giggles at \\nRachel’s shaky witticism. A pimp is happy when his whores giggle. He \\nknows they are still asleep. \\n\\nI coasted the Hog into the curb outside the hotel where Kim, my newest, \\nprettiest girl, was cribbing. Jesus! I would be glad to drop the last whore off. I \\ncould get to my own hotel to nurse my nose with cocaine and be alone. Any \\ngood pimp is his own best company. His inner-life is so rich with cunning \\nand scheming to out-think his whores. \\n\\nAs Kim got out I said, “Goodnight Baby, today is Saturday. I want \\neverybody in the street at noon instead of seven tonight. I said noon, not five \\nminutes after or two minutes after. At twelve sharp I want you down, got it \\nBaby?” \\n\\nShe didn’t answer. She did a strange thing. She walked into the street \\naround the Hog to the window on my side. She stood looking at me for a long \\nmoment, her beautiful face tense in the dim dawn. \\n\\nThen in her crisp New England accent she said, “Are you coming back to \\nmy pad this morning? You haven’t spent a night with me in a month. So \\ncome back, okay?” \\n\\nA good pimp doesn’t get paid for screwing. He gets his pay-off for always \\nhaving the right thing to say to a whore right on lightning tap. I knew my four \\nwhores were flapping their ears to get my reaction to this beautiful bitch. A \\npimp with an overly-fine bitch in his stable has to keep his game tight. \\nWhores constantly probe for weakness in a pimp. \\n\\nI fitted a scary mask on my face and said, in a low, deadly voice, “Bitch, \\nare you insane? No bitch in this family calls any shots or muscles me to do \\nanything. Now take your stinking yellow ass upstairs to a bath and some \\n\\n\\n\\nshut-eye. Get in the street at noon like I told you.” \\n\\nThe bitch just stood there. Her eyes slitted in anger. I could sense she was \\ngame to play the string out right there in the street before my whores. If I had \\nbeen ten-years dumber I would have leaped out of the Hog, broken her jaw, \\nand put my foot in her ass. The joint was too fresh in my mind. \\n\\nI knew the bitch was trying to booby-trap me when she spat out her \\ninvitation. “Come on, kick my ass. What the hell do I need with a man I only \\nsee when he comes to get his money? I am sick of it all. I don’t dig stables \\nand never will. I know I’m the new bitch who has to prove herself. Well \\nGoddamnit, I am sick of this shit. I’m cutting out.” \\n\\nShe stopped for air and lit a cigarette. I was going to blast her ass off when \\nshe finished. I just sat there staring at her. \\n\\nThen she went on, “I have turned more tricks in the three months I have \\nbeen with you than in the whole two years with Paul. My pussy stays sore \\nand swollen. Do I get my ass kicked before I split? If so, kick it now because \\nI’m going back to Providence on the next thing smoking.” \\n\\nShe was young, fast with trick appeal galore. She was a pimp’s dream and \\nshe knew it. She had tested me with her beef. She was laying back for a \\nsucker response. \\n\\nI disappointed her with my cold overlay. I could see her wilt as I said in an \\nicy voice, “Listen square-ass bitch, I have never had a whore I couldn’t do \\nwithout. I celebrate, Bitch, when a whore leaves me. It gives some wormy \\nbitch a chance to take her place and be a star. You scurvy Bitch, if I shit in \\nyour face, you gotta love it and open your mouth wide.” \\n\\nThe rollers cruised by in a squad car. I flashed a sucker smile on my face. I \\ncooled it until they passed. Kim was rooted there wincing under the blizzard. \\n\\nI went on ruthlessly, “Bitch, you are nothing but a funky zero. Before me \\nyou had one chili chump with no rep. Nobody except his mother ever heard \\nof the bastard. Yes, Bitch, I’ll be back this morning to put your phony ass on \\nthe train.” \\n\\nI rocketed away from the curb. In the rear-view mirror I saw Kim walk \\nslowly into the hotel. Her shoulders were slumped. Until I dropped the last \\nwhore off you could have heard a mosquito crapping on the moon. I had \\ntested out for them, solid ice. \\n\\nI went back for Kim. She was packed and silent. On the way to the station, \\nI riffled the pages in that pimp’s book in my head. I searched for an angle to \\nhold her without kissing her ass. \\n\\n\\n\\nI couldn’t find a line in it for an out like that. As it turned out the bitch was \\ntesting and bluffing right down the line. \\n\\nWe had pulled into the station parking lot when the bitch fell to pieces. Her \\neyes were misty when she yelped, “Daddy, are you really going to let me \\nsplit? Daddy, I love you.” \\n\\nI started the prat action to cinch her when I said, “Bitch, I don’t want a \\nwhore with rabbit in her. I want a bitch who wants me for life. You have got \\nto go. After that bullshit earlier this morning, you are not that bitch.” \\n\\nThat prat butchered her. She collapsed into my lap crying and begging to \\nstay. I had a theory about splitting whores. They seldom split without a \\nbankroll. \\n\\nSo I cracked on her, “Give me that scratch you held out and maybe I’ll \\ngive you another chance.” \\n\\nSure enough she reached into her bosom. She drew out close to five bills \\nand handed it to me. No pimp with a brain in his head cuts loose a young \\nbeautiful whore with lots of mileage left in her. I let her come back. \\n\\nAt long last I was driving toward my hotel. I remembered what Sweet \\nJones, the master pimp who turned me out, had said about whores like Kim. \\n\\n“Slim,” he had said, “A pretty Nigger bitch and a white whore are just \\nalike. They both will get in a stable to wreck it and leave the pimp on his ass \\nwith no whore. You gotta make ’em hump hard and fast to stick ’em for long \\nscratch quick. Slim, pimping ain’t no game of love, so prat ’em and keep \\nyour swipe outta ’em. Any sucker who believes a whore loves him shouldn’t \\na fell outta his mammy’s ass.” \\n\\nMy mind went back to Pepper. Then back even further and I remembered \\nwhat he had said about the Georgia. \\n\\n“Slim, a pimp is really a whore who has reversed the game on whores. So \\nSlim, be as sweet as the scratch, no sweeter, and always stick a whore for a \\nbundle before you sex her. A whore ain’t nothing but a trick to a pimp. Don’t \\nlet ’em Georgia you. Always get your money in front just like a whore.” \\n\\nI was on the elevator riding to my pad. I thought about the first bitch who \\nhad Georgiaed me when I was three. She had flim-flammed me out of my \\nhead. She would be old and gray now. If I could find her, I would sure get the \\nbitch’s unpaid account off my conscience. \\n\\nI snorted a couple of caps of cocaine. Two hours later I took a yellow. I fell \\nasleep. \\n\\nWhen I woke up at noon, I knew I had to make a move. Rachel’s parents \\n\\n\\n\\nwere trying to cross me. Kim might split back to the sucker. My whole stable, \\nexcept Kim, were local girls. A pimp is asking for trouble when he doesn’t \\nmove his action away. \\n\\nControl is easier and tighter away from the familiar setting. A girl in \\nstrange surroundings depends more on her man. She needs his advice and \\nguidance more. Girls copped in smaller towns have to be moved fast. \\n\\nThat night I went to Ohio. I put down the foundation for the move. I rented \\ntwo houses and furnished them beautifully. I made contact with a fellow who \\ncollected the oil for the heat. I got the okay to go at a C a week for each \\nhouse. I moved my whole family there. I was just in time. A month later \\nDetroit folded and the lid slammed down. \\n\\nThere was a good dope connection in the new town. I started capping H \\nwith my C. I’d mix them and shoot speedballs. When I went to bed I got \\nsound sleep. I seldom had those bad dreams. I got hooked on H. It didn’t \\nworry me. I was getting long scratch. \\n\\nI was thirty years old. For the second time in my pimping career I could \\nsee solid success and lots of long green in my future. How could I know that \\nelephant bitch, Serena, would get jealous? She brought the whole green-back \\nhouse of cards crashing down around me. I missed a murder rap by a fraction \\nof an inch. The fraction was in Serena’s chest. \\n\\nWithin the year that I had set up my houses, tricks from all over the county \\nwere beating a path to them. They were wild to sample those luscious young \\nfreaks. Pimping had never been better. \\n\\nI was in a wonderful mood as I walked in the sunshine. I noticed Serena \\nwas coming up the street with a sack of groceries in her arm. She had croaked \\ntwo people in New Orleans. She walked toward me smiling. When she got \\nclose to me she got the ice pick out of the sack. She jabbed it toward my \\nchest. At the time I was quite quick, so I leaped back. The point of it slashed \\nthe edge of my pocket right over my ticker. She was trying to drive the point \\nright through my ticker. \\n\\nI was without a pistol at the time. I could buy a pistol from any hardware \\nstore. I bought a .32 and a box of fifty bullets. I took it up to her pad and \\nloaded it at the kitchen table. \\n\\nShe said, “Daddy, what’s that for?” \\n\\nI said, “That’s to croak any bitch that tries to hurt me.” \\n\\nShe said, “Oh Daddy, you know I was just upset. Forget about it.” \\n\\nI said, “No, I’m not going to forget about it. I’d kill my own mother if I \\n\\n\\n\\nthought she was going to hurt me.” \\n\\nLater that evening about midnight the other girls and I were returning from \\na cabaret. I put the key in the door. I opened it and smelled the heavy odor of \\nTabu. The heavy scent that only Serena used. I hesitated. My eyes became \\naccustomed to the gloom. I saw Serena standing over in the corner of the \\nliving room with an ice pick in her hand. She had slipped into Rachel’s house \\nthrough an open basement window. I drew my gun. \\n\\nI said, “Serena!” \\n\\nShe said, “Yes, mother-fucker. I’m killing you and them whores this \\nmorning.” \\n\\nShe started crying. \\n\\nI said, “Serena, don’t come by that end table. If you do I’m going to kill \\nyou. You know I always keep my word.” \\n\\nShe said, “I wouldn’t give a mother-fuck.” \\n\\nShe lunged past the end table. I shot her. When I shot her the only thing \\nthat saved her life was the fact that she had a forty-six inch bust. The fatty \\ntissue absorbed the bullet at almost point-blank range. \\n\\nWhen I shot her, blood splattered. I struck her in an artery. It blew all over \\nmy face, all over her. Her dress had a ringlet of sparks. I set her on fire. She \\nhad elephant toughness. It didn’t even knock her down. The bitch grabbed at \\nme. She had dropped the ice pick. \\n\\nShe grabbed her chest and said, “Daddy, don’t kill me!” \\n\\nI was tempted. I really intended to kill her. I started to shoot her through \\nthe head. I didn’t. I don’t really know why except there were witnessess, \\nthose four whores. She staggered past us through the door and down the \\nstreet. We all got into the Fleetwood and raced out of town leaving \\neverything. \\n\\nI sped toward Mama. I hadn’t seen her since that Christmas visit. Her hair \\nwas snow white. Jesus! Was she excited and happy to see me. I told her what \\nhad happened. She got a friend to drive her back there. She loaded all the \\nclothing on a trailer. She visited Serena in the hospital. \\n\\nSerena begged my mother to tell me to come back. She wouldn’t file \\ncharges. It was all her fault and she loved me. I knew that if I had gone back \\nSerena would have driven a butcher knife through my heart in my sleep. \\n\\n\\n\\n20 \\n\\nSTABLE MOVES \\n\\n\\nIt had been a sucker move to come to Mama. Fortunately she had moved \\nfrom over the beauty shop. She now lived in an almost all-white \\nneighborhood. Here I was with four idle whores in a closed town where I had \\nfallen three times. It was the point of origin for the white slave rap that the \\ncopper-hearted runt had crossed me with. There were a couple of sneak ten- \\ndollar houses in town. \\n\\nI stayed inside the house at Mama’s. Every joker in town knew me. They \\nall had diarrhea of the mouth. I couldn’t put my action in the street in this hot \\ntown. They’d had an easy go in Ohio. They were soft. I could put them down \\nonly in a town where I had a fix. I knew that none of them, if busted, could \\nstand up under the clever grilling of the F.B.I. \\n\\nI had a ten G bankroll. I was housing and feeding four whores in an \\nexpensive hotel. I was a pig for banging speedballs. No fresh scratch was \\ncoming in. With only a ten G stick I knew I would soon be in trouble. I had to \\nmake a move fast. It was bad for morale of the stable to keep them on their \\nasses. \\n\\nAfter a week of confinement at Mama’s house, I slipped out of town to cop \\nH and C for myself, and gangster for the girls. While in the city I looked up \\nSweet. I was careful because all the heat in the neighborhood knew me. \\n\\nSweet insisted I give him all the details of my escape. He shook his skull in \\nawe when he heard them. Miss Peaches had died of old age. His eyes were \\nsad when he told me about it. Glass Top was still out West in Seattle. Patch \\nEye did a little bookie business for him. Sweet had lost his glory. He looked a \\nhundred years old. His backbone was the old white broad who owned the \\nbuilding. \\n\\nSweet had just beat a murder rap. He had killed some pretty jerk from St. \\n\\n\\n\\nLouis who had insulted him in the Roost. The poor chump had called Sweet \\nan ugly, gray-ass bastard. Sweet had drawn his pistol on him. He prodded \\nhim into an alley. He made him kneel and then he pissed on him. This was \\ntoo much to take, so the kid lost his temper. Sweet shot him through the top \\nof the head. \\n\\nSweet was laughing, in a good mood as he told me about it. It had cost him \\nfive grand to beat it. He told me he got a wire that Red Eye got life for \\ncroaking a whore in Pittsburgh. \\n\\nSweet had a complete answer to my problem. He said that since Serena \\nhadn’t beefed I should go back into Ohio. No state was better at the time for \\nhouse or street. Before I left I went to his John. The door had a padlock on \\nthe outside. \\n\\nHe looked at me, grinned, and said, “Pal, my crapper is out of order.” \\n\\nI went downstairs to the John in the bookie joint. On the way out I asked \\nPatch Eye why Sweet didn’t get his toilet fixed. \\n\\nThe old ex-pimp, without looking up answered, “Shit, ain’t nothing wrong \\nwith the crapper. That cold bastard has his two whores locked in there for \\nfucking with his scratch. They been in there three days.” \\n\\nI walked toward my car. I wondered how long Sweet would keep them \\nthere and how long the whores could live with just water. \\n\\nI got back from the city. I stopped downtown at Rachel’s suite. I stayed for \\nthe night. I outlined the move. The next morning I was looking out the \\nwindow down on the street. There was a stooped white-haired joker dumping \\nbarrels of hotel garbage into a huge truck. It was Steve. I’d know him in hell! \\n\\nA hot-flash shot through me. I don’t know what happened after that. \\nRachel told me I snatched my thirty-two from my coat pocket in the closet. I \\nran to the service elevator in my pajamas. She followed me all the way to the \\nstreet. I didn’t say a word. The truck had pulled away when we reached the \\nsidewalk. \\n\\nShe got me back upstairs. It had been a sucker play for a fugitive. Lucky \\nfor me no rollers showed on the scene. I dressed and told Rachel I’d be back \\nlater and I wanted the rest of the stable in her joint. \\n\\nI stopped at a leather-goods shop and bought a small valise. It was about \\nthe size that a doctor carries. I stopped at several banks and cracked some of \\nmy big bills into enough singles to fill the bag. I went to Mama’s to prepare \\nthe flash. I filled it almost to the brim with singles. I put the remaining big \\nbills on top. I was getting ready to ship my stable. With my plan I could ship \\n\\n\\n\\nthem without a strong fix. Even new whores think twice before leaving a rich \\npimp. \\n\\nThat afternoon they were all in Rachel’s plush suite. She was the boss \\nbitch. They had twenty-five dollar a day, neat rooms on the same floor. I \\nwalked in. They were smoking gangster and eager for my speech. \\n\\nThey were anxious to get back on the track. I had loosened the catch on the \\nbag. I casually hurled it onto the table before them. A bale of hundred-dollar \\nbills jumped from the bag. Reefer enhances what you see. I saw on those \\nwhores’ faces that they were seeing every dollar of the mountain of \\ngreenbacks they had given me for the years I had been their man. \\n\\nConfidence flooded their eyes. I finished my briefing and my instructions. \\nI had built my shining castles in the air. Brother, I could have sent those \\nwhores to Siberia, in bikinis, in the wintertime. Keeping her wife-in-laws and \\nmy scratch straight up there in Toledo was the first acid test for Rachel as a \\nbottom woman. \\n\\nI stayed around Mama’s for a week. She was bugging me to embrace the \\nHoly Ghost and the Fire. She begged me to square up and repent my sins. No, \\nit was a little late for that. I moved onto Ohio again. \\n\\nCleveland was only a short hop to Toledo. I set up a mad apartment in the \\nlarger city. Cleveland was jumping. I was ready for the best pimping of my \\ncareer. Kim ran off with a wealthy white trick but I didn’t miss her. Both \\ntowns were crawling with young fine whores. The name of the game was still \\n“cop and blow.” \\n\\nWithin four mouths I had the three girls in Toledo and five in Cleveland. I \\nwas pimping good. I had a connection for staff. All was perfect except for \\none thing. Rachel’s name was ringing. Every pimp, con man and rich dope- \\npeddler was shooting for her. They offered soft, irresistible propositions. \\n\\nHer head was getting as big as a pumpkin. I didn’t want to lose her. I had \\nanother more serious reason for wanting to hold her. If I blew her, she might \\npull a runt on me and go to the F.B.I. I got it through the wire that a slick \\ncon-man out of New York was using his beautiful Jasper white girl as bait to \\ncop Rachel. The same wire said that Rachel was getting weak for the broad. \\n\\nI went to Toledo one early morning to Rachel’s. Sure enough there they \\nwere, the three of them in Rachel’s bed. Believe me they hadn’t gotten in \\nthere to recite bedtime stories. I was cool, icy as always. I let her con me that \\nit was a party, all business of course. That wire had described that bastard con \\nplayer and his freak woman. \\n\\n\\n\\nI was in trouble. If it had been any other bitch in the stable except Rachel it \\nwouldn’t have been worth a fleeting thought. I couldn’t lose Rachel, my \\nbottom woman, in this shitty fashion to some ass-hole con player. \\n\\nIt could kill my career as a pimp. The news would flash in a dozen states. \\nNo, I couldn’t afford to lose her. I still had that expensive friend riding with \\nme, that monkey on my back. Sweet would have had the solution to this \\ntough problem right off the top of his head. Sweet, the week before, had shot \\nhimself in the temple. He left a bitter note, “Good-bye squares! Kiss my \\npimping ass!” \\n\\nI felt nothing when I got the wire. I left her apartment and drove out into \\nthe country. I spun the wheels in my skull. I got the key to the riddle. It was \\ncruel but perfect. If it worked I’d never have to worry that she’d blow or \\ncross me with the F.B.I. \\n\\nRachel called me the next day. She told me she had just sent me three bills. \\nShe got them for the party I had crashed. When she cracked I knew I had to \\ngo through with the cross. The three bills she was sending had to be scratch \\nshe had been holding out. That con bastard was too pretty and slick to spend \\nthree fat-ones with a whore. I had to make an honest whore of her from now \\non. \\n\\nI faked excitement when I told her about a sucker who was visiting Akron. \\nIt’s a small town, thirty miles from Cleveland. I told her I got a wire that the \\nsucker had hit the numbers for twenty G’s. He had it all with him in his hotel \\nroom. \\n\\nI sold her that she could take it off smooth and easy. She said she would be \\ndown the next day to get briefed in detail. \\n\\nI had already driven to Akron and set the stage for her. I had rented a hotel \\nroom in a fair hotel. I contacted a dignified looking old ex-slum hustler down \\non his luck. He spruced up a wino friend of his for the play. \\n\\nThe whole arrangement: clothes, room, and a bill apiece for the actors, \\ncame to a half-grand. The slum hustler was to wait in a pool room nearby for \\nmy call. \\n\\nRachel got to my apartment at three p.m. We got to Akron around six. I told \\nher one of the bellhops had told the sucker she would be there before seven. \\nHe was waiting for her. \\n\\nI slipped a small vial of mineral oil into her palm. I told her it was Chloral \\nHydrate. Only two drops would knock the sucker out. I told her I would be \\nwaiting in the hotel bar for her. \\n\\n\\n\\nShe stopped at the desk. Sure enough he was expecting her. She went up. \\nShe came down within an hour nervous and jumpy. The sucker was out cold. \\nShe had searched the room. She couldn’t find the scratch. I went back to the \\nroom with her. I went through another search. The wino was lying there \\nmotionless. We gave up searching. We moved toward the door. I looked back \\nat the wino. \\n\\nI said, “Say Baby, he looks bad to me.” \\n\\nI knelt beside him blocking her view with my back. I wiped my brow and \\nturned my face toward her. My eyes were wide in alarm. \\n\\nI said, “Baby, he’s dead I think.” \\n\\nMost women, even whores, are terrified of dead bodies. She stood there \\nparalyzed. \\n\\nI said, “Don’t get panicky. Shut that door. I’ve got it! I know an \\nunderworld croaker here in town. Maybe he can bring him to. I know he will \\nkeep his mouth shut for a price, even if ...” \\n\\nShe knew we couldn’t leave a murdered man here. She had stopped at the \\ndesk first before coming up. She was painfully aware of the big gap between \\ntheft and murder. I picked up the phone and got the pool room. I gave the \\nfake doctor the hotel and room number. He came within five minutes \\ncarrying his empty bag. \\n\\nShe couldn’t see into it. I had told her to hide in the closet. Too many \\npeople had seen her already. He stooped down beside the wino. He fumbled \\nwith his pulse, his eyelids. \\n\\nFinally he stood up and said, “He’s dead. I can’t help him. I’ll have to call \\nthe police.” \\n\\nI could almost hear Rachel’s heart booming in the closet. We haggled for \\nher benefit for ten minutes. Finally we had a deal. For five bills, he would \\nkeep his mouth shut. He would also contact a hoodlum who would get the \\nbody out of there and dispose of it. He left. Rachel and I got out of there fast. \\n\\nDriving back to Cleveland, Rachel was in a trance. She squeezed tightly \\nagainst me. I kept telling her she had nothing to worry about. After all we \\nwere together for life and her secret would always be safe with me. She found \\nout about the hoax years later. \\n\\nRachel straightened up with that murder pressure on her. Toledo was on \\nfire and in one month my three girls got nine cases between them. I pulled \\nthem out into Cleveland. Cleveland was lousy with pimps and whores and \\nboosters from all over the country. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe mob of hustlers set the torch to Cleveland. By nineteen-fifty-three the \\nstreets were so hot a whore was lucky to stand up a week between falls. I was \\na fugitive. For almost a year I never left my apartment. I couldn’t risk arrest \\nand a fingerprint check. I was down to four girls. That year in the apartment \\nwas cramping my style. \\n\\nMama had hit a romantic and financial jack-pot. She had moved to Los \\nAngeles. She called me every week pleading with me to visit her. She wanted \\nme to meet my new stepfather and stay for a while. I kept stalling her. I had \\nheard that the smack in California was only six percent. The pimps out there \\nwere only half serious. This makes for bad pimping conditions. \\n\\nSeveral Eastern pimps had gone to the coast in good shape. They had \\nreturned torn down. They said the Western whores were lazy and were \\nsatisfied with making chump change. The Western pimps had spoiled them. \\n\\nI gave myself logical arguments against the move to California. Why \\nshould I expose my well-trained whores to that dangerous half-ass scene out \\nWest? What if I blew my family out there in the hinterlands? \\n\\nI was thirty-four now. In any square profession I would have been in my \\nprime. As a pimp I was getting elderly. I was stern and strict on my women. \\n\\nRachel wired me that a stud with a stable of boosters was in town with a \\nload of wild Lilli Anne suits and Petrocelli vines at twenty percent of retail. \\nShe got me his number the next day. \\n\\nI called him and got an appointment to look his stock over. I only left the \\napartment for important reasons. I decided I would cop a piece of stuff and a \\nfresh outfit before seeing him. \\n\\nHe was staying at a crummy hotel on the East Side. He let me into a \\ncracker-box three-room apartment. He sounded me down to make sure of my \\npedigree. \\n\\n“So, you’re Iceberg, huh? I was in your town not long ago. Philly sure is \\nhot.” \\n\\nHe knew me by reputation and that I was from Chicago. \\n\\nI said, “Yes, I’m Iceberg from the Windy.” \\n\\nHe said, “Say Jim, how ‘bout old Red Eye? I saw him in New York last \\nmonth. He’s pimping a zillion. Surely you know him.” \\n\\nI gave him that look, like I had caught him frenching a sissy. \\n\\nI said, “Listen carefully. Jack. I don’t have time for bull-shit. I knew Red \\nEye. You saw him last month, Jack? You better see a head-shrinker. You’re \\nflipping your top. Red Eye caught the big one in Pittsburgh five years ago. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe’s doing it all.” \\n\\nHe gave me a grin like he had swallowed a bottle of snot. He got the sizes \\nfrom me. He said to cool it in his pad. He had to go to his stash across the \\nstreet to get the merchandise. \\n\\nI glanced into the tiny bedroom. There was a naked broad lying on the bed. \\n\\nI said to myself, “I wonder what kind of dog that is.” \\n\\nI went to the bed and looked down at her. She was drunk, stoned. It looked \\nlike the runt. This broad was buxom, almost fat. I knew one way to be sure. I \\nhad lashed the blood out of her with that hanger whipping years ago. She \\nwould still have the scars. I flipped her over on her belly. They were there. \\n\\nI stood there looking down at her. I remembered that tough bit in \\nLeavenworth. Here at my mercy was that stinking bitch, Phyllis. Just the \\nsight of her made me crazy. \\n\\nI grabbed a cologne bottle off the dresser. I jerked the big top off. I got my \\nbag out. I dumped enough of the twenty percent stuff into the top to croak a \\nsick junkie. She was clean. \\n\\nI spotted a bottle of mixer water on the floor. I filled the top and struck a \\nmatch. I held it beneath the top. I rammed my gun into it. I drew up her \\nreckoning. \\n\\nI stabbed the outfit into a vein just back of her knees. Her red blood \\nstreaked up into the joint. I was just about to press the pacifier bulb. I looked \\nout the window. I caught a glimpse of the joker darting across the street. He \\nhad a steamer trunk headed toward the front door of the hotel. \\n\\nI froze, jerked the spike out of her. I thrust the loaded outfit inside my shoe \\nunderneath my instep. I pinned the bag to my shorts between my legs. I \\ncollapsed into the living-room chair just as he came through the door. I was \\nsweating like hell. He was suspicious. He kept looking from the corner of his \\neye at his broad. \\n\\nHe thought I had been riding her in his absence. I wondered how long he’d \\nhad her. He was a wrong-doer. He’d cut her loose when he got hip to what he \\nhad. Sooner or later someone would pull his coat. He’d find out the runt had \\nsent me to the joint. I was getting what I wanted from the merchandise. He \\nslipped into the bedroom and checked her cat out. \\n\\nI left with the dozen items I had bought. I knew I had bought going-to- \\nCalifornia clothes. I had quizzed him about his plans. He was going to stay in \\nCleveland for weeks. I had to leave town. Now. \\n\\nPhyllis was sure to get the wire from him that I was in town. I knew she \\n\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t hesitate to drop a dime in the phone to the heat. She had to know \\nabout the escape. I drove away. I tried to picture the expression on her face \\nwhen her man cracked to her that Iceberg had been up there alone with her \\nwhile she was stoned. \\n\\nI got a flight that night for L.A. It’s fabulous when a pimp’s bottom girl \\ncan be trusted to handle his scratch and his whores. She was welded to me by \\nthat murder cross. The stable would drive out later in the Hog. \\n\\nMama was radiantly happy out there and my stepfather was a wonderful \\nsquare. They lived in a big house. L.A. was worse than the reports I had \\ngotten. I got around in Mama’s Coupe de Ville. After the second night I went \\ninto the whore and pimp stomping grounds. \\n\\nI stayed around Mama for another week then went up to Seattle. Glass \\nTop’s name wasn’t ringing. In fact he was almost unknown. One stud told me \\nGlass Top had croaked. \\n\\nI copped a gorgeous hash-slinger up there. I turned her out that week. \\nLucky I did. I lost a girl back in Cleveland. Her appendix burst. I pulled the \\nthree left into Seattle. \\n\\nAfter I had been in town six months, fate dealt me one off the top for a \\nchange. My bag was empty and the stuff in town was around six percent. I \\nhad to shoot three spoons to stay well. The girls were humping up a storm, I \\nwas getting no inside grief. \\n\\nI was sitting in the Hog one day. An old withered stud walked past me. He \\ncame back and stooped down looking at me. \\n\\nHe shouted, “Ice, my old pimping buddy.” \\n\\nI took a close look. It was Glass Top. He got in. He patted the scraggly \\nprocessed hair on his nearly-bald head. He’d done a long bit in the state joint. \\nHe wasn’t pimping. An old square broad was feeding him. He was a drunk. \\nUntil I left town I bought him bottles and rapped with him. He croaked two \\ndays after I left town. \\n\\nI ran into the croaker who aborted Helen. He had lost his license and done \\na short bit back East for an abortion. We started rapping a lot to each other. \\nHe knew most of the hustlers I knew so we had much in common. He kept \\ntelling me how bad I looked. He told me how handsome I’d been when I \\nbrought Helen to him. \\n\\nHe needled me. He expressed doubt that I had the guts to kick. He was \\ngame to help me kick if I was game to kick. I decided to let him help me. He \\nwarned me I would have to follow his every instruction. He had a house in \\n\\n\\n\\ntown. He still took a fast buck from his old hustle. \\n\\nRachel was the only girl in the family who knew I was hooked. None of \\nthe rest knew. I was going to stay at the Doc’s to kick. They thought I was \\nout of town. \\n\\nHe used the system of reduction. We reached the tearing, puking, none-at- \\nall stage. Let me tell you that beautiful croaker bastard was immune and rock- \\nhard. I tried the raving, crying con on him. He would jab a needle into me to \\ntranquilize me so he couldn’t hear my bleating. I tell you, if you have ever \\nhad the flu real bad, just multiply the misery, the aching torture by a \\nthousand. That’s what it’s like to kick a habit. \\n\\nIt took two weeks. I was weak, but with an appetite like a horse. In another \\ntwo weeks I was stronger than I’d been in years. The Doc will always be my \\nman. If he hadn’t come to my rescue, and I had kept that habit until nineteen- \\nsixty, I would have been a corpse within a week in that steel casket waiting \\nfor me. \\n\\n\\n\\n21 \\n\\nTHE STEEL CASKET \\n\\n\\nSeattle had played out. It was nineteen-fifty-eight. My stepfather died, \\nleaving Mama all alone back in California. Her letters were full of her grief \\nand loneliness. I had blown down to Rachel and the young hash-slinger I’d \\nturned out. \\n\\nI had put on fifty pounds since I kicked the habit. I weighed more than \\ntwo-hundred pounds. Time had scissored away my hair in front. I didn’t look \\nmuch like the mug shot of that sleek escapee. \\n\\nI smoked a little gangster and snorted cocaine now and then. I actually \\ncopped a cap of H once with my C. I wanted to mix it in a speedball. It was \\nhard to flush the H down the drain. \\n\\nAt almost forty I was ancient as a pimp. I looked like a black, fat seal in \\nmy expensive threads. For the first time in many years I had rediscovered my \\nappetite for good food. I was slowing down. I spent most of my time reading \\nin bed. The end of my pimping career wasn’t far in the future. \\n\\nI made the decision to go back to the fast track. I stayed away from old \\nhaunts. I had put my two girls to work in the street near downtown. Most of \\ntheir tricks were white. I stayed in a nice hotel nearby. They lived together in \\nthe same hotel. Three months after I got back, a fire changed my pimping \\nsetup. The change set up the chain of events that busted me for the escape. \\n\\nI was taking a walk. I stopped to watch flames gut an apartment building. \\nAn old brown-skin stud was watching beside me. He was a sure-shot craps \\nhustler. He also sold working togs to whores in houses in ten states. After the \\nfire we went and had a drink together. We liked each other right away. For \\nthe next month we saw each other every day. I started going with him to the \\nwhorehouses to peddle his merchandise. \\n\\nI’d always had contempt for whores who worked houses. They gave up \\n\\n\\n\\nfifty percent of the scratch to a madam. I’d always believed a good whore \\nwent to the street to meet the trick. Even when I had the houses in Ohio my \\nwhores got their tricks in the street. \\n\\nLazy, half-ass whores worked houses and let the trick come to them. My \\nfriend, Bet ’Em Big, convinced me whorehouses were the thing for me. His \\npoints were that the wear and tear on a pimp was less. The houses were \\nprotected and the madams were responsible for falls. Also a girl didn’t need \\nthe complicated turn out for houses. \\n\\nA pimp’s blows would be at least fifty percent less in the houses. He told \\nme at my age I could grind up a bankroll in the houses. Then I could open a \\ncouple of my own and live to get a hundred years old. I wouldn’t live that \\nlong under the stress and strain of the street. \\n\\nTwo months later I had both my girls in houses. I got my scratch every \\nMonday in money orders by registered mail. Just like he said, it was an easy \\nway to pimp. The fifty percent off the top, I couldn’t miss. I never had it. \\n\\nThe girls would work maybe a month or two before coming in to visit me. \\nI spent the time between with Bet ’Em Big. He was a real pal. He blew his \\ntop when I ignored his advice and tapped almost out for a new fifty-nine Hog. \\n\\nI loved him like a father. He knew all the percentages on craps and people. \\nHis friendship and wisdom maybe helped me to stay away from H. Maybe if \\nI hadn’t gone to jail I would have gone back to it. I was tempted a dozen \\ntimes. \\n\\nI moved Stacy, the younger whore, to a house in Montana. It was March. \\nShe was up there for the season. This meant every six weeks or so I’d have to \\ngo up there to service her and tighten my game. She was lonesome. She’d \\ncall and write to tell me how much she missed me. \\n\\nShe fell out with the madam and started working in a house run by a stud \\nin the same town. I told Bet I was going up to visit her. \\n\\nHe said, “Ice, you can’t take good advice. You were a sucker to go broke \\non that new Hog. Now here is more good advice. Ice, not only should you not \\ngo up there, you better pull that fine bitch out of there. I know that stud. He’s \\na snake. Pull her out! I know a spot in Pennsylvania just as good. Inside of \\ntwo days you can pull her and place her.” \\n\\nI didn’t take his advice. I took a train up to visit her. I rented a room in a \\nmotel. I registered as Johnny Cato. It was on the outskirts of town. The only \\nNegroes ever in town were whores in houses and pimps come to visit them. \\n\\nShe’d come to the motel in early morning after work. She confessed to me \\n\\n\\n\\nthat she woke up one day and found her boss in bed with her. In her alarm \\nshe struck him on the head with a heavy brass clock. It didn’t chill him. He \\nwiped the blood away and gave her fifty slats to get his rocks. He begged her \\nto quit me and be his woman. It was a bitch of a time to tell me. \\n\\nIt was the third and last day of my visit. It was Sunday night around nine. \\nShe didn’t work Sundays. We were playing around. I had my pajamas on. I \\nhad a cap of C in a pocket. I was just lighting a cigarette when a roller-type \\nknock shook the door and me. I went to the door. \\n\\nI said, “Yes, who is it?” \\n\\nHe said, “Police, open the door.” \\n\\nI opened it. It was two red-faced Swede rollers. One was porcine, the other \\nlanky. I put my shaking hands into the pajama pockets. My fingertips touched \\nthe scorching hot cap of cocaine. I hoped I was keeping the fear out of my \\nface. I gave them a wide toothy smile. They came in and stood in the middle \\nof the room. Their eyes were racing about the room. Stacy was open-mouthed \\nin the bed. \\n\\nI said, “Yes gentlemen, what can I do for you?” \\n\\nLanky said, “We wanta see your ID.” \\n\\nI went to the closet and got the phony John Cato Fredrickson ID. I put it in \\nhis palm. I felt cold sweat running down my back. They looked at it, then \\nlooked at each other. \\n\\nLanky said, “You are in violation of the law. You signed the motel register \\nimproperly. Why didn’t you sign your full name? What are you trying to \\nhide? What are you doing here in town? It says here you’re a dancer. We \\ndon’t have a club in town that books entertainers.” \\n\\nI said, “Officers, my professional name is Johnny Cato. I’ve got nothing to \\nhide. My full name had always been too long for the marquees. I’ve fallen \\ninto the habit of using the shorter version. \\n\\n“My legs went out last year. I don’t dance anymore. My wife and I decided \\nto go into business. We are making a tour of this part of the country. We \\nthink that in your town we’ve found the ideal site for a Southern fried \\nchicken shack. My wife has a secret recipe that should make us rich up here.” \\n\\nPorky said, “You’re a Goddamn black lying sonuvabitch. Every one of you \\nNiggers come up here to open another cat house or suck your whore’s pussy. \\nYou and that bitch aren’t married. You’re a low life pimp and she’s your \\nwhore. I’ve seen her around. I’m telling you boy, get your Nigger ass out of \\ntown. We don’t want you here.” \\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “Yes Sir, I’ll forget about the restaurant like you say.” \\n\\nThey turned and walked out. I knew Stacy’s boss had put his finger on me. \\nIt was too late to catch the train back to the city. There was one a day at eight \\np.m. I knew they’d be back. I was trapped. I’d heard radio bulletins warning \\nthat the highways were snowed under. I couldn’t even walk out of town. I \\nsnorted the sizzle and sat trying to figure a way out. \\n\\nThe chief of police came back at three the next afternoon. I let him in. \\n\\nHe said, “Boy, I’m not satisfied. I’m going to forget about the phony \\nregistration. Now there’s a more serious matter. If you and this young woman \\naren’t legally married you’ve broken a law I can’t overlook. When and where \\nwere you married?” \\n\\nI thought fast. I tried to remember a courthouse fire from the newspapers. I \\ncouldn’t. \\n\\nI said, “Sir, we were married three years ago in Waco, Texas. I just can’t \\nunderstand why you doubt we’re married.” \\n\\nHe said, “I’m going to take you in. I’m going to check your story. If you’re \\ntelling the truth, I’ll let you go. If not, you’ll get a jail sentence.” \\n\\nHe took us down. We were mugged and fingerprinted. Afterwards we were \\ntaken to his office. \\n\\nHe said, “Boy, you lied to me. I called Waco. There’s no record of your \\nmarriage.” \\n\\nThey locked us up. An hour later we walked out on two-hundred dollar \\nbonds each. We got a cab to the motel. I understood the bond delay. The joint \\nhad been searched. We got her stuff from the whorehouse and sat in the train \\nstation until eight p.m. \\n\\nWe got back to the city early that morning. I knew when my fingerprints \\ngot to Washington the F.B.I. would rush back the news I was a fugitive. I had \\nto get out of town. \\n\\nThe police chief knew my destination when I left his town. “Bet ’Em Big” \\ncalled Pennsylvania. Stacy was parked, ready to leave for the new spot the \\nnext day. The chief must have flown my fingerprints to Washington. \\n\\nThe city rollers, with a captain of guards from the joint busted Stacy and \\nme. I was held for the escape. Stacy for harboring me. There was one angle I \\ncouldn’t figure. All the way to the lock-up it bothered me. How did the city \\npolice and that screw know just where in that big city to put their hands on \\nme? \\n\\nI had been transferred to county jail when I figured it out. I have made \\n\\n\\n\\nmany stupid mistakes in my life. None was more stupid than the one that put \\nme back in the shit house. I had a letter in my bag from Stacy. The rollers that \\nsearched our room while we were in jail made a notation of my city address. I \\nhad played the hick coppers cheap and here I was with my balls in the fire. \\n\\nRachel rushed to me from the whorehouse. I fought the charge of escape. \\nAfter all, they couldn’t prove it to the extent that they could tell in court how \\nI had escaped. At my first hearing I told the judge I hadn’t escaped. I told him \\none night before midnight a screw unlocked the cell and took me to the front \\ngate and released me. I had a friend who had supplied the scratch for the \\nunderground release. \\n\\nIt was a very thin story, but it was strong enough to forestall my return to \\nthe joint. I was sure bad things would happen to me back there. Bet visited \\nme. He offered to do anything for me. I was lost. No one could help me. \\n\\nMama came from California to visit me. She was sick and old. In fact she \\nwas dying. She had heart trouble and diabetes. I don’t see how she made the \\ntrip. It was an old scene. I was in a barred cage. She was crying on the \\noutside of it. \\n\\nShe sobbed, “Son, this is the last time we are going to see each other. Your \\nMama’s so tired. God gave me the strength to make the long trip to see my \\npoor baby fore I go to sleep in Jesus’ arms. Son, it’s too bad you don’t love \\nme as much as I love you.” \\n\\nI was crying. I was squeezing her thin, pale hands in mine between the \\nbars. \\n\\nI said, “Now look Mama, you know we all got Indian blood in us. Mama \\nyou ain’t gonna die. Mama, I’ll live to get a hundred like Papa Joe, your \\nfather. Come on now Mama, stop it. Ain’t I got enough worry? Mama I love \\nyou. Honest Mama. Forgive me not writing regular and stuff like that. I love \\nyou Mama, I love you. Please don’t die. I couldn’t take it while I’m locked \\nup. I’ll take care of you when I get out. I swear it Mama. Just don’t die. \\nPlease!” \\n\\nThe screw came up. The visit was over. His hard face softened in pity as he \\nlooked at her. He knew she was critically sick. I watched her move slowly \\naway from me down the jail corridor. She got to the elevator. She turned and \\nlooked at me. She had a sad, pitiful look on her face. It reminded me of that \\nstormy morning long ago she had stood in the rain and watched the van \\ntaking me to my first prison bit. I get a terrible lump in my throat even now \\nwhen I relive that moment. \\n\\n\\n\\nA week passed after Mama visited me and went back to California. \\n\\nI went into court for the third and last time. The judge ordered me into the \\ncustody of the joint’s captain of screws. Stacy was released. \\n\\nThe captain and his aide were grimly silent. Their prison sedan sliced \\nthrough the sparkling April day. I was on the rear seat. I gazed at the \\nscurrying, lucky citizens on the street. I wondered what they’d use on me at \\nthe joint, rubber hoses or blackjacks? I felt so low. I wouldn’t have cared if \\nI’d dropped dead right on the car seat. \\n\\nWe went through the big gate into the joint. The warm April sun shone \\ndown on the ancient grimy buildings. \\n\\nThe yard cons leaned on their brooms. They stared through the car window \\nat me. The sedan came to a stop. We got out. They took off my handcuffs. I \\nwas taken into the same cell house from which I’d made the escape thirteen \\nyears before. I was locked in a cell on the flag. \\n\\nIn the early afternoon a screw marched me to the office of the chief of the \\njoint’s security. He looked like a pure Aryan storm trooper sitting behind his \\ndesk. He didn’t have a blackjack or a rubber hose in his hand. He was \\ngrinning like maybe Herr Schickelgruber at that railroad coach in France. His \\nvoice was a lethal whisper. \\n\\nHe said, “Well, well, so you’re that slick blackbird who flew the coop. \\nCheer up, you only owe us eleven months. You’re lucky you escaped before \\nthe new law. There’s one on the books now. It penalizes escapees with up to \\nan extra year. \\n\\n“Ah, what a shame it isn’t retroactive. I am going to put you into a \\npunishment cell for a few days. Nothing personal mind you. Hell, you didn’t \\nhurt me with your escape. Tell me confidentially, how did you do it?” \\n\\nI said, “Sir, I wish I knew. I am subject to states of fugue. I came to that \\nnight and I was walking down the highway a free man. Sir, I certainly wish I \\ncould tell you how I did it.” His pale cold eyes hardened into blue agates. His \\ngrin widened. \\n\\nHe said, “Oh, it’s all right my boy. Tell you what, you’re a cinch to get a \\nclear memory of just how you did it before long. Put in a request to the cell- \\nhouse officer to see me when you regain the memory. Well good luck my \\nboy, ’til we meet again.” \\n\\nA screw took me to the bathhouse. I took a shower and changed into a \\ntattered con uniform. A croaker examined me, then back to the cell house. \\nThe screw took me to a row of tiny filthy cells on the flag. My first detention \\n\\n\\n\\ncell was on the other side of the cell house. The screw stopped in front of a \\ncell. He unlocked it. He prodded me into it. It was near the front of the cell \\nhouse. I looked around my new home. \\n\\nIt was a tight box designed to crush and torture the human spirit. I raised \\nmy arms above me. My fingertips touched the cold steel ceiling. I stretched \\nthem out to the side. I touched the steel walls. I walked seven feet or so from \\nthe barred door to the rear of the cell. I passed a steel cot. \\n\\nThe mattress cover was stained and stinking from old puke and crap. The \\ntoilet and washbowls were encrusted with greenish-brown crud. It could be a \\nsteel casket for a weak skull after a week or two. I wondered how long they’d \\npunish me in the box. \\n\\nI turned and walked to the cell door. I stood grasping the bars, looking out \\nat the blank cell-house wall in front of me. \\n\\nI thought, “The Nazi figures after a week or so in this dungeon I’ll be \\ncrying and begging to tell him how I escaped. I’m not going to pussy-out. \\nHell, I got a strong skull. I could do a month in here.” \\n\\nI heard a slapping noise against the steel space between the cells. I saw a \\nthin white hand holding a square of paper. I stuck my arm through the bars of \\nmy cell door. I took the paper. It was a kite with two cigarettes and three \\nmatches folded inside. \\n\\nIt read, “Welcome to Happiness Lane. My name is Coppola. The vine said \\nyou’re Lancaster, the guy who took a powder thirteen years ago. I was \\nclerking in an office up front. I took my powder a year and a half ago. \\n\\n“They brought me back six months ago. I’ve started to cash in my chips a \\ndozen times. You’ll find out what I mean. I’ve been right in this cell ever \\nsince. I got another year to go with the new time stacked on top for the \\nescape. I got a detainer warrant from Maine for forgery up front. \\n\\n“We’re in big trouble, buddy. The prick up front has cracked up four or \\nfive cons in these cells since I came back ... There’s six of us on the row \\nnow. Only three are escapees. The rest are doing short punishment time like \\ntwo days to a week. I’ll give you background on other things later, I know \\nwhat screws will get anything you want for a price.” \\n\\nI lit a cigarette and sat on the cot. I thought, Coppola is a helluva stud to \\nkeep his skull straight for six months on Happiness Lane. He doesn’t know \\nI’m just here for a few days.” \\n\\nThat night we had a supper of sour Spanish rice. I heard the shuffling feet \\nof cons filing into the cell house. They were going into their cells on the tiers \\n\\n\\n\\noverhead. The blaring radio loudspeakers and the lights went off at nine. \\nOver the flushing of toilets and epidemic farting, I heard my name \\nmentioned. The speaker was on the tier just above my cell. \\n\\nHe said, “Jim, how about old Iceberg, the mack man? Jim, a deuce will get \\nyou a sawbuck the white folks will croak him down there. A pimp ain’t got \\nthe heart to do a slat down there.” \\n\\nJim said, “Jack, I hope the pimp bastard croaks tonight. One of them pimps \\nput my baby sister on stuff.” \\n\\nI dozed off. After midnight I woke up. Somebody was screaming. He was \\npleading with someone not to kill him. I heard thudding sounds. I got up and \\nwent to the cell door. I heard Coppola flush his john. \\n\\nI stage whispered, “Coppola, what’s happening, man?” \\n\\nHe whispered, “Don’t let it bug you, Lancaster. It’s just the night screws \\nhaving their nightly fun and exercise. They pull their punching bags from the \\ncells on the other side. It’s where drunks and old men are held for court in the \\nmorning. \\n\\n“Buddy, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Don’t give them any lip if they ever \\ncome by and needle you. They’ll beat hell out of you. Then take all your \\nclothes off and put you in a stripped cell. That’s one with nothing in it, just \\nthe cold concrete floor. Buddy, there are at least a dozen ways to die in here.” \\n\\nAll the rest of the night I lay staring at the blank dirty wall in front of me. I \\nwondered what Rachel and Stacy were doing. I had to make contact with a \\nscrew to mail some letters on the outside for me. The joint censors would \\nnever let whore instructions pass through. Every few minutes a screw would \\npass and flash his light on me. \\n\\nThat morning I watched the cell-house cons file past my cell on the way to \\nbreakfast and then to their work. All new arrivals the day before were also in \\nthis line. \\n\\nThat afternoon I got letters from Stacy and Rachel. They had also sent \\nmoney orders. They missed their strong right arm. They were working bars \\ndowntown. “Bet” was handling any falls they might take. \\n\\nCoppola within the first week hipped me to the angles of survival. I had a \\nscrew who would take letters directly to the girls. He would get his pay-off \\nfrom them. He would bring me cash from them. \\n\\nI got a letter from Mama. I could hardly read the shaky writing. She sent \\nme religious tracts inside it. I was really worried about her. The tight cell and \\nthe fear of a year in it was getting to me. The little sleep I got was crowded \\n\\n\\n\\nwith nightmares. I was eating good at high prices. I still lost weight. \\n\\nThe first month I lost thirty pounds. Then I got bad news twice within the \\nfifth week. I got a letter from Stacy. Bet had been found dead on his toilet \\nstool at home. It really shook me. He had been a real friend. I got a very short \\nnote from Rachel. She was in Cleveland. \\n\\nIt said, “I ran into an old doctor friend of yours the other night. He was \\nlooped. He bought me a drink. Lucky for me the bartender asked how you \\nwere doing. The doctor spilled his guts. He told me about a dead patient of \\nhis who came back to life. My worst wishes. P.S. Please drop dead. I’ll keep \\nthe Hog.” \\n\\nThe joint waived the balance of Coppola’s time to face the rap in Maine. \\nThe skull pressure was getting larger. The cell was getting tighter. With \\nCoppola gone I was in real trouble the third month. It was like a deadly hex \\nwas at work to crack me up. \\n\\nNone of the screws would cop heavy drugs for me. I settled for whiskey. I \\nstopped using the safety razor. I didn’t want to see the gaunt ugly stranger in \\nmy sliver of mirror. It wasn’t just the cell. It was the sights and sounds of the \\nmisery and torment on the row and in the nightmares. \\n\\nMama was bedridden. She was too sick to write. I got telegrams and letters \\nfrom her friends. They were all praying that I’d get out before Mama passed. \\nI got a pass to the visitors cage. A screw took me and stood behind me the \\nwhole time. It was Stacy. She was pregnant and living with an old hustler. \\nHer eyes told me how bad I looked. Her letters dropped off to one a month \\nwith no scratch. \\n\\nAt the end of the fourth month my skull was shaking on my shoulders like \\nI had palsy. A con on the row blew his top one night around midnight. He \\nwoke up the whole cell house. At first he was cursing God and his mother. \\nThe screws brought him past my cell. \\n\\nIn my state the sight of him almost took me into madness. He was buck \\nnaked and jabbering a weird madman’s language through a foamy jib. It was \\nlike the talking in tongues Holy Rollers do. He was jacking-off his stiff swipe \\nwith both hands. I gnawed into my pillow like the runt to keep from \\nscreaming. \\n\\nThe next day I put in a request to see the Nazi. Nothing happened. A week \\nlater I was sitting on the John with my head between my knees. I heard the \\nmorning line moving to breakfast. The line had stalled for a moment right \\noutside my cell door. \\n\\n\\n\\nI looked up into a pair of strange almost orange eyes sunk into an old \\nhorribly scarred face. It was Leroy. I had stolen Chris from him many years \\nago. He still remembered me. He stared at me and smiled crookedly as the \\nline moved out. \\n\\nI got my screw to check his rap sheet. The screw gave me the whole \\nrundown. Since nineteen-forty Leroy had been arrested more than a hundred \\ntimes for common drunk. He had also been committed to mental hospitals \\ntwice. I was forty-two. I was twenty when I stole Chris from him. I asked the \\nscrew to pull strings to send him to another cell house. I gave him a rundown \\non the Chris steal and how weak Leroy had been for her. The screw told me \\nhe couldn’t cut it. \\n\\nLeroy was doing only five days for drunk. Leroy had to stay in the cell \\nhouse. I wondered how Leroy would try for revenge. I had to be careful in the \\nmorning for the next five days. I had to keep my feet and legs away from the \\ncell door. Leroy might score for a shiv and try to hack something off when he \\npassed my cell. I worried all day about what he would do. Could he somehow \\nget gasoline and torch me? \\n\\nThat night I heard the voice for the first time. The lights were out. The cell \\nhouse was quiet. The voice seemed to be coming through a tiny grille at the \\nhead of the cot. \\n\\nA light always burned in the breezeway behind the grille. The pipes for all \\nthe plumbing for the cells were there. I got down on my hands and knees and \\nlooked through the grille’s tiny holes. I couldn’t see anybody. \\n\\nI got back on the cot. The voice was louder and clearer. It sounded friendly \\nand sweet like a woman consoling a friend. I wondered if cons on one of the \\ntiers above me were clowning with each other. \\n\\nI heard my name in the flow of chatter. I got back down and listened at the \\ngrille. A light flooded the corner. It was the screw. I spun around on my \\nknees facing him. The light was in my eyes. He said, “What the hell are you \\ndoing?” \\n\\nI said, “Officer, I heard a voice. I thought someone was working back \\nthere.” \\n\\nHe said, “Oh, you poor bastard. You won’t pull this bit. You’re going nuts \\n‘Slim.’ Now stop that nonsense and get in that cot and stay there.” \\n\\nThe cellhouse lights woke me up. My first thought was Leroy. I got up and \\nsat on the cot. Then I thought about the voice. I wasn’t sure now. Maybe it \\nhad been a dream. \\n\\n\\n\\nI wondered whether I should ask the screw about it. One thing for sure, \\ndream or not, I didn’t want to go nuts. My mind hooked on to what I’d heard \\nthe old con philosopher say about that screen in the skull. I remembered what \\nthe books at federal prison said about voices and even people that only \\nexisted inside a joker’s skull. \\n\\nI thought, “After this when I get the first sign of a sneaky worry, thought or \\nidea. I’ll fight it out of my skull.” \\n\\nMaybe I wasn’t dreaming when I heard that voice. If I hear it again I’ll \\nhave some protection. I’ll keep a strong sane voice inside to fight off \\nanything screwy from going on. \\n\\nEvery moment I’ll stand guard over my thoughts until I get out of here. I \\ncan do it. I just have to train that guard. He’s got to be slick enough not to let \\ntrouble by him. I’ll make him shout down the phony voices. He’ll know \\nthey’re not real right away. \\n\\nI got up and went to the face bowl. I heard the rumbling feet of the cons \\ncoming off the tiers. I was washing my face. I heard a series of sliding bumps \\non the floor behind me. It was like several newsboys all throwing your paper \\non the porch in rotation. Then I smelled it. I turned toward the door. I \\nsquinted through the soap on my eyelids. I had been bombed with crap. \\n\\nIt was oozing off the wall. The solid stuff had rolled to my feet. Pieces of \\nloosely rolled newspaper were the casings. Cons were passing my door \\nsnickering. I felt dizzy. A big lead balloon started inflating inside my chest. I \\nremembered the inside guard. He was new and late on the job. I puked. \\n\\nI shouted over and over, “Watch out now, it’s only crap, it’s only crap. It’s \\njust crap. Watch out, it can’t hurt you. It’s only stinking crap.” \\n\\nA screw stood at the cell door twitching his nose. He was screaming, “Shut \\nUp!” \\n\\nHe opened the cell. I got a bucket of hot water and a scrub brush. I cleaned \\nthe cell. The screw asked me who fouled my nest. I told him I didn’t know. \\n\\nMy screw came to see me at noon. He told me how Leroy had enlisted the \\ncrap-bombers. Leroy told them I had put the finger on him years ago when he \\ngot the bit for the Papa Tony beating. My screw dropped the truth around the \\ncell house. All the bombers were down on Leroy. They dared him to bother \\nme again. I was safe from Leroy. I didn’t mourn when Leroy finished his \\nfive-day bit. It was the end of my sixth month. I beat down worry, voices, and \\ncountless thoughts of suicide with the skull-guard plan. \\n\\nA friend of Mama’s sent me a telegram. Mama had been stricken. The \\n\\n\\n\\nhospital doctors had given her up. Then she bounced back. She was very sick \\nnow, but still alive. The telegram gave my skull gimmick a tough test. \\n\\nI had a very sad day around the middle of the seventh month. A booster \\nfrom New York busted on his second day in town was on the tier above me. \\nA con on my row several cells down called me one night to borrow a book. A \\nmoment later I heard my name called from up above. He came down next \\nmorning and rapped to me. His job was in the cell house. \\n\\nThe booster asked me if I were the Iceberg who was a friend of Party \\nTime. I told him yes. He didn’t say anything for awhile. Finally he told me \\nParty had often spoken of me as the kid he once hustled with who grew up to \\nbe Iceberg the pimp. \\n\\nHe told me Party had copped the beautiful girlfriend of a dope dealer when \\nhe got a bit. Party turned her out. The dope dealer did his bit. The broad tried \\nto cut Party loose to go back to a life of ease. \\n\\nParty went gorilla on her. He broke her arm. Two months later Party \\ncopped some H. He didn’t know his connection was a pal of the dealer who \\ngot the bit. It was H all right mixed with flakes of battery acid. I didn’t sleep \\nthat night. \\n\\nI had come to a decision in that awful cell. I was through with pimping and \\ndrugs. I got insight that perhaps I could never have hoped to get outside. I \\ncouldn’t have awakened if I had been serving a normal bit. After I got the \\nmental game down pat I could see the terrible pattern of my life. \\n\\nMama’s condition and my guilty conscience had a lot to do with my \\ndecision. Perhaps my age and loss of youth played their parts. I had found out \\nthat pimping is for young men, the stupid kind. \\n\\nI had spent more than half a lifetime in a worthless, dangerous profession. \\nIf I had stayed in school, in eight years of study I could have been an M.D. or \\nlawyer. Now here I was, slick but not smart, in a cell. I was past forty with \\ncounterfeit glory in my past, and no marketable training, no future. I had been \\na bigger sucker than a square mark. All he loses is scratch. I had joined a club \\nthat suckered me behind bars five times. \\n\\nA good pimp has to use great pressure. It’s always in the cards that one day \\nthat pressure will backfire. Then he will be the victim. I was weary of \\nclutching quicksilver whores and the joints. \\n\\nI was at the end of the ninth month of the bit. I got a front office interview. \\nI was contesting my discharge date. I was still down for an eleven month bit. \\n\\nAn agent of the joint had been in the arresting group. I spent thirty days in \\n\\n\\n\\ncounty jail before the transfer to the joint to finish out the year. I knew little \\nor nothing about law. I was told at the interview I had to do eleven months. I \\nwasn’t afraid I’d crack up serving the extra month. By this time I had perfect \\ncontrol of my skull. \\n\\nMama might die in California at any time. I had to get to her before she \\ndied. I had to convince her I loved her, that I appreciated her as a mother. \\nThat she and not whore-catching was more important to me. I had to get there \\nas much for myself as for her. \\n\\nI lay in that cell for two weeks. I wrote a paper based on what I believed \\nwere the legal grounds for my release at the expiration of ten months. It had \\nsubtle muscle in it too. I memorized the paper. I rehearsed it in the cell. \\nFinally I felt I had the necessary dramatic inflection and fluid delivery. It was \\ntwo days before the end of the tenth month. I was called in two weeks after I \\nhad requested the second interview. \\n\\nI must have looked like a scarecrow as I stood before him. I was bearded, \\nfilthy, and ragged. He was immaculate seated behind his gleaming desk. He \\nhad a contemptuous look on his face. \\n\\nI said, “Sir, I realize that the urgent press of your duties has perhaps \\ncontributed to your neglect of my urgent request for an interview. I have \\ncome here today to discuss the vital issue of my legal discharge date. \\n\\n“Wild rumors are circulating to the effect that you are not a fair man, that \\nyou are a bigot, who hates Negroes. I discounted them immediately when I \\nheard them. I am almost dogmatic in my belief that a man of your civic \\nstature and intellect could ill afford or embrace base prejudice. \\n\\n“In the spirit of fair play. I’m going to be brutally frank. If I am not \\nreleased the day after tomorrow, a certain agent of mine here in the city is \\ngoing to set in motion a process that will not only free me, but will possibly \\nin addition throw a revealing spotlight on certain not too legal, not too \\npleasant activities carried on daily behind these walls. \\n\\n“I have been caged here like an animal for almost ten months. Like an \\nanimal, my sensitivity of seeing and hearing has been enhanced. I only want \\nwhat is legally mine. My contention is that if your Captain of guards, who is \\nlegally your agent, had arrested me and confined me on such an unlikely \\nplace as the moon for thirty days, technically and legally I would be in the \\ncustody of this institution. Sir, the point is unassailable. Frankly I don’t doubt \\nthat my release will occur on legal schedule. Thank you. Sir, for the \\ninterview.” \\n\\n\\n\\nThe contempt had drained out of his face. I convinced him I wasn’t \\nrunning a bluff. His eyes told me he couldn’t risk it. After all, surely he knew \\nhow easy it was to get contraband in and out of the rotten joint. Getting a kite \\nto an agent would be child’s play. I didn’t sleep that night. The next day I got \\na discharge notice. I would be released on legal schedule. \\n\\n\\n\\n22 \\n\\nDAWN \\n\\n\\nI had amazed cons and guards alike, I had survived it. I was getting out in \\ntwenty-four hours. I was almost forty-three sitting in a cell. \\n\\nI thought, “I have been in a deadly trap. Have I really escaped it? Does fate \\nhave grimmer traps set? Can I learn to be proud of my black skin? Can I \\nadjust to the stark reality that black people in my lifetime had little chance to \\nescape the barbed-wire stockade in the white man’s world?” \\n\\nOnly time and the imponderables inside me would answer the questions. \\n\\nI had no one except Mama. They dressed me out. My clothes flopped \\naround on my skeletal frame. I still hadn’t told them how I had escaped. Cons \\ncheered me as I shuffled toward freedom. They knew how I had suffered and \\nwhat the awful odds had been that I wouldn’t have made it. \\n\\nA friend of Mama’s had sent me my fare. As the plane flew over the sea of \\nneon, I looked down at the city where I had come so many years ago in \\nsearch of an empty lonesome dream. \\n\\nI thought of Henry and the sound of that pressing machine. Of Mama when \\nshe was young and pretty. How wonderful it had been back there in \\nRockford. She would come into my room at bedtime, a tender ghost, and tuck \\nme in warmly and kiss me goodnight. It seemed a long time before I finally \\ngot to her. \\n\\nWhen I walked into her room, death was there in her tiny gray face. Her \\neyes brightened and flashed a mother’s deathless love. Her embrace was firm \\nand sure. My coming to her had been like a miracle. It was the magic that \\ngave her strength. \\n\\nShe clutched life for an added six months. I never left the house for those \\nsix months. We would lie side by side on twin beds and talk far into the \\nnight. She made me promise that I would use the rest of my life in a good \\n\\n\\n\\nway. She told me I should get married and have children. \\n\\nI tried hard to make up for all those years I had neglected her. It’s hard to \\nsquare an emotional debt. That last sad day she looked up into my eyes from \\nthe hospital bed. \\n\\nIn a voice I could scarcely hear through her parched lips, she whispered, \\n“Forgive me Son, forgive me. Mama didn’t know. I’m sorry.” \\n\\nI stood there watching her last tears rolling down her dead cheeks from the \\nblank eyes. I crushed her to me. \\n\\nI tried to get my final plea past death’s grim shield, “Oh Mama, nothing \\nhas been your fault, believe me, nothing. If you are foolish enough to think \\nso, then I forgive you.” \\n\\nI staggered blindly from the hospital. I went to the parking lot. I fell across \\nthe car hood and cried my heart out. I stopped crying. I thought Mama had \\nreally gotten in the last word this time. \\n\\nThese stinking whores would have gotten a huge charge if they could have \\nseen old Iceberg out there wailing like a sucker because his old lady was \\ndead. \\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE \\n\\n\\nI am lying in the quiet dawn. I am writing this last chapter for the publisher. \\n\\nI am thinking, “How did a character like me, who for most of his life had \\ndevoted himself to the vilest career, ever square up? By all the odds, I should \\nhave ended a broken, diseased shell, or died in a lonely prison cell.” \\n\\nI guess three of the very important reasons are lying asleep in the bedroom \\nacross the hall. I can see their peaceful, happy faces. They don’t know how \\nhard and often discouraging it is for me to earn a living for them in the square \\nworld. \\n\\nThis square world is a strange place for me. For the last five years I have \\ntried hard, so hard, to solve its riddles, to fit in. \\n\\nCatherine, my beautiful wife, is wonderful and courageous. She’s a perfect \\nmother to our adorable two-year-old girl, and our sturdy, handsome three- \\nyear-old boy. \\n\\nIn this new world that isn’t really square at all, I have had many bitter \\nexperiences. I remember soon after my marriage how optimistic I was as I set \\nout to apply for the sales jobs listed in the want ads. \\n\\nI knew that I was a stellar salesman. After all, hadn’t I proved my gift for \\nthirty years? The principles of selling are the same in both worlds. The white \\ninterviewers were impressed by my bearing and apparent facility with words. \\nThey sensed my knowledge of human nature. \\n\\nBut they couldn’t risk the possible effect that a Negro’s presence would \\nhave on the firm’s all white personnel. In disgust and anger, I would return \\nhome and sulk. Bitterly I would try to convince myself to go back into the \\nrackets. Catherine always said the right things and gave me her love and \\nunderstanding. \\n\\nThere was another indispensable source of help and courage during these \\nhard times. She’s a charming, brilliant woman. She had been a friend to my \\nmother. She functioned as a kind of psychotherapist. She explained and \\npointed out to me the mental phases I was passing through. She gave me \\ninsight to fight the battle. To her I shall always be grateful. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe story of my life indicates that my close friends were few. Shortly \\nbefore I started this book I met a man I respected. I thought he was a true \\nfriend. I was bitterly disillusioned to discover he wasn’t. I’m glad in a way it \\nturned out the way it did. I’ve always come back stronger after a good kick in \\nthe ass. \\n\\nI have had many interesting and even humorous experiences in this new \\nlife. They will have to wait for now. I see my little family is awake. I’ll have \\nto light the heater. I can’t let them get up in the early morning chill. \\n\\nHow about it, an Iceberg with a warm heart? '"
